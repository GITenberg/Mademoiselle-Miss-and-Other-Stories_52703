     </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>aris is the
      gloomiest town in Christendom to-day,&mdash;though it is a lovely day in
      April, and the breeze is full of softness, and the streets are gay with
      people,&mdash;and the Latin Quarter is quite the dullest bit of Paris:
      Mademoiselle Miss left last night for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all know what it is like when a person who has been an absorbing
      interest in our lives suddenly goes away: how, apart from the immediate
      pang of the separation and the after-pain of more or less consciously
      missing the fugitive, there is a wide, complex, dim underworld of emotion,
      that may be compared to the thorough-bass of a sad tune, and seems in some
      sort to relate itself to the whole exterior universe. The sun rises as
      usual, but the sunlight is not the same. Other folk, apparently
      unconcerned, pursue the accustomed tenor of their way; but we are vaguely
      surprised that this should be the case,&mdash;surprised, and grieved, and
      a little resentful. We can&rsquo;t realise without an effort how completely
      exempt they are from the loss that has befallen us; and we feel obscurely
      that their air of indifference is either sheer braggadocio, or a symptom
      of moral insensibility. The truth of the matter is, of course, that our
      departing friend has taken with him not his particular body and baggage
      only, but an element from the earth and the sky. and a fibre from
      ourselves. Everything is subtly, incommunicably altered. We wake up to a
      changed horizon: and our distress is none the less keen because the
      changeling bears a formal resemblance to the vanished original.
    </p>
    <p>
      So! Mademoiselle Miss has gone to England; and to-day it is anew and an
      unfamiliar and a most dismal Paris that confronts the little band of
      worshippers she has left behind her. Indeed, it was already a new Paris
      that the half dozen of us who had assembled at St. Lazare to see her off,
      emerged into from the station last night, after her train had rolled away.
      We found a corner seat for her in a third-class compartment reserved for
      dames seules; and while some of us attended to the registering of her box,
      others packed her light luggage into the rack above her head; and this man
      had brought a bunch of violets, and that a book for her to read; and Jean
      contributed a bottle of claret, and Jacques a napkin full of sandwiches:
      and taken for all in all, we were the forlornest little party you can
      easily conceive of, despite our spasmodic attempts at merriment. We
      grouped ourselves round the window of her carriage,&mdash;stopping the way
      thereby, though not with malice aforethought, for such other solitary
      ladies as might wish to enter,&mdash;whilst Miss smiled down upon us from
      eyes that were perilously bright; and we sought to defy the ache that was
      in our hearts, by firing off brisk little questions and injunctions, or
      abortive little jests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;ve got your ticket all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must make a rush for a berth directly you reach Dieppe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you write the moment you arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll get news of her through Don Antonio.&rdquo;&mdash;This was meant as
      facetious, and we all laughed, though rather feebly: Don Antonio being an
      aged Italian model whom Miss had painted a good deal, and between whom and
      herself there was humorously supposed to have taken place a desperate
      flirtation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were constantly lapsing into silence, however; and for the last five
      minutes we scarcely spoke at all. We simply waited there, moving uneasily
      among ourselves, and gazed up at her. She kept on smiling at us; but it
      was a rueful smile, and we could easily see that the tears weren&rsquo;t far
      behind it. Then suddenly a bell rang; the officials shouted &ldquo;<i>En voiture</i>;&rdquo;
       there was a volley of good-byes, a confusion of handshaking; the engine
      shrieked; her arm was drawn in through the window; the train moved; and
      Miss was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lingered for a moment on the platform, looking stupidly after the red
      lamp at the end of the last carriage, as it waned swiftly smaller and
      fainter in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently someone pulled himself together sufficiently to say, &ldquo;Well, come
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And we made our way out of the station into a Paris that was blank and
      strange. Aubémont (Adolphe) was frankly holding his pocket-handkerchief to
      his eyes; but we Anglo-Saxons chid and chaffed him till he put it out of
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Christopher! when I think of the way we treated that girl in the
      beginning!&rdquo; cried Chalks, an American, whose lay-name is Charles K. Smith,
      but he&rsquo;s called Chalks by all his English-speaking fellow-craftsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereat&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; came in chorus from the rest of us. We didn&rsquo;t
      care to be reminded of those old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then little Schaas-Keym, the Dutchman, proposed that we should finish the
      evening, and court oblivion, at the Galurin Cassé: and we adopted his
      suggestion, and drank beer, and smoked, and chattered, and ate cold beef
      and pickles, till the place was closed, at 2 a. m., when we returned to
      the Quarter, six in a single cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we managed to wear out last night with sufficient comfort. We gave
      ourselves no time, no chance, to think. We stood together, and drowned our
      sorrow in the noise we made. And then, by the time we parted, we were
      sleepy, so that we could go straight to our beds and forget everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      But&mdash;this morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is proverbially on the next morning that a man&rsquo;s wound begins to hurt.
      For the others, since I&rsquo;ve seen none of them, I can speak only by
      inference: in the morning our little <i>cénacle</i> scatters to the four
      corners of the town, not to be reunited till the hour of dinner; but what
      reason is there to doubt that the day will have treated them very much as
      it has treated me? And oh, the weary, dreary, bright spring day it is! The
      Luxembourg is fragrant with budding trees, and vocal with half a thousand
      romping children; the Boule-Miche is at its liveliest, with a ceaseless
      ebb and flow of laughing young men and women; the <i>terrasse</i> of the
      Vachette is a mass of gleaming top-hats and flaunting feminine bonnets;
      and the sky overhead is one smooth blue vault, and the sun is everywhere,
      a fume of gold: but the sparkle and the joyousness of it all are gone.
      Turn where I will, I find the same awful sense of emptiness. The streets
      are deserted, in spite of the crowds: I can hear my solitary footsteps
      echo gruesomely through them. Paris is like Pompeii.
    </p>
    <p>
      After luncheon, thinking to obtain relief by fleeing the Quarter (where
      every blessed stick and stone has its bitter-sweet association with her),
      I crossed the river, mixed with the throng in the Boulevard, sat for a
      while at the Café de la Paix. But things were no whit better. The sun
      shone with the same cheerless brilliancy; the air touched one with the
      same light, uncomforting caress; the laughter of the wayfarers had the
      same hollow ring. A blight had fallen upon man and nature. I came back to
      the Rue Racine, and its ghosts of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That exclamation of Smith&rsquo;s last night, to which we all cried taboo,
      really hit one of the salient points of the position: when I think of the
      way we treated her in the beginning! Extenuating circumstances might be
      pleaded for us, no doubt. It was only natural that we should have treated
      her so, if tradition and convention can make a thing natural&mdash;if it
      is natural that men should glare at a woman in a smoking-carriage, for
      example. And besides, she has had her revenge. For that matter, she was
      never conscious of our offences; but she has had her revenge, if to see us
      one by one prostrate ourselves at her feet, humble adorers, eager
      servitors,&mdash;if that may constitute revenge. And then, we are told,
      though our sins be as red as scarlet, if we do truly repent, they shall be
      washed as white as snow: and we have repented, goodness knows how truly.
      All the same, forgiveness without forgetfulness being but the guinea-stamp
      without the gold, I wish I could forget the way we treated her in the
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One is judged by the company one keeps; and she kept&mdash;ours. It is now
      some nine months ago that she appeared in it, at the Hôtel de l&rsquo;.céan et
      de Shakespere, in the Rue Racine. We were just hasty enough, unobservant
      enough, blunt enough of perception, to judge her accordingly,&mdash;to
      take for granted, in a casual, matter-of-course fashion, that she would be
      a vessel of like clay to our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance to the Hôtel de l&rsquo;.céan et de Shakespere, a narrow, dark,
      ambiguous-looking entrance, is flanked by two tin signs. That at the right
      hand reads, &ldquo;<i>Chambres ci Cabinets Meublés</i>,&rdquo; that at the left, &ldquo;<i>Pension
      de Famille</i>.&rdquo; Call it a <i>Pension de Famille</i>, if you will: at the
      epoch when Mademoiselle Miss arrived among us, we were, to put it
      squarely, the most disreputable family in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our proprietress, Madame Bourdon, was a gelatinous old person from
      Toulouse, with a pair of hazy blue eyes, a mottled complexion, a
      worldly-wise smile, an indulgent heart, and an extremely nasal accent. I
      speak of her as old; but she wasn&rsquo;t old enough to know better, apparently.
      At any rate she had a certain unbeneficed <i>abbé</i> perpetually hanging
      to her apron-strings, and she kept him to dinner half a dozen evenings in
      the week. Of her boarders all the men were students, all the women <i>étudiantes</i>,&mdash;which,
      being interpreted, I suppose means students too. There were Mesdames
      Germaine, Fifine, Olga, Yvonne, Zélie, and Lucile,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Whose names are six sweet symphonies,</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and perhaps it was
      because Lucile was her niece that Madame had dubbed her shop a <i>pension
      de famille</i>. You paid so much for your room and service, and then you
      could take table d&rsquo;hôte or not, as you elected. Most of us took it,
      because it was only fifty francs a month, <i>vin compris</i>. Our ladies
      dined abroad a good deal, being inconstant quantities, according to the
      custom of their sex; but the men were almost always present in full
      number. We counted seven: Chalks, Schaas-Keym, Aubêmont, Jeanselme,
      Campbell, Norton, and myself. We formed a sort of close corporation, based
      upon a community of tastes, interests, and circumstances. We were all
      &ldquo;arts,&rdquo;&mdash;except Jeanselme, who was a &ldquo;mines,&rdquo; with a disordered
      tendency to break out in verse: we were all ridiculously poor, and we were
      all fond of bohemianising up and down the face of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening in September of last year, on entering our <i>salle-à&mdash;manger</i>,
      we beheld a stranger, an addition to our ranks; and Madame, with a
      comprehensive gesture, introduced her to us in these terms: &ldquo;<i>Une
      nouvelle, une anglaise, Mees,...</i>&rdquo; Then she made awful hash of rather a
      long-winded English name: and we were content to accept the newcomer
      simply as Miss. The concierge and the servants, though, (to anticipate a
      little), treated Miss as a <i>petit-nom</i>, like Jane or Susan, and
      prefixed the title Mademoiselle. The pleonasm seemed a happy one, and we
      took it up: Mademoiselle Miss. On her visiting-card the legend ran, &ldquo;Miss
      Edith Thorowether.&rdquo; It was probably as well, on the whole, that French
      lips should not too frequently have tackled that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if she had been plain or elderly or constrained in her bearing or
      ill-natured-looking, no doubt we should have felt at once the difference
      between her and ourselves, and understood her presence with us as merely
      the outward and visible sign of some inward and spiritual blunder. But, as
      it happened, she was young and distinctly pretty; and she appeared to be
      entirely at her ease; and she smiled graciously in acknowledgment of the
      somewhat cursory nods with which we favoured her. We hadn&rsquo;t the wit or the
      intuitions to recognise her ease for the ease of innocence; and our hotel
      was <i>such</i> a risky box; and ladies of English or American origin were
      no especial novelty in the Quarter; and we didn&rsquo;t stop to examine this one
      critically, or to consider; and so things fell out in a way we now find
      disagreeable to remember. It was Saul who had strayed by hazard into the
      midst of our prophetic councils; and we mistook him for one of our own
      prophetic caste, and proceeded to demean and express ourselves in our
      usual prophetic manner. Fortunately, Saul&rsquo;s knowledge of our prophetic
      tongue was limited. We spoke the slang of the Boulevards; whilst the
      little French that Mademoiselle Miss was mistress of she had learned from
      Ollendorf and Corinne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was partially cleared up, I forget how long afterwards, by
      our discovering in her room, whither she had bidden us for an evening&rsquo;s
      entertainment, an ancient copy of a certain Handbook to Paris,&mdash;&ldquo;the
      badge of all our tribe,&rdquo; as the tourist called it. On opening to its list
      of hotels (which somebody did by chance), we found the following note,
      with a pencil-mark against it: &ldquo;Hotel de l&rsquo;.céan et de Shake-spere, Rue
      Racine, chiefly frequented by visitors pursuing art-studies: well
      spoken-of and inexpensive.&rdquo; That explained it. Mademoiselle Miss had
      trusted to a guide that was ten years behind the times: so the date on the
      title-page attested. And in ten years how had the Hôtel de l&rsquo;.céan et de
      Shake-spere fallen from its respectable estate!&mdash;unless, ten years
      ago, the editor of that most exemplary handbook had been egregiously
      imposed upon. In his current edition the paragraph that I have cited does
      not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to the evening of her arrival. In our <i>salle-à-manger</i>
      there was a rigid division of the sexes. The men sat on one side of the
      long table, the women on the other, with &lsquo;Madame and her <i>abbé</i> cheek
      by jowl at the head. It was the only arrangement Madame had been able to
      effect, whereby to maintain amongst us something resembling order.
      Mademoiselle Miss had a seat assigned to her between Zélie and Yvonne,
      nearly opposite Chalks and myself; and she entered without embarrassment
      into conversation with all four of us. That is to say, she responded as
      well as she could in her broken classic French, and with perfect
      amiability, to such remarks as we directed at her. Save in addressing
      Madame or the <i>abbé</i>, nobody ever thought of saying <i>vous</i> at
      our unceremonious board; and Miss showed neither displeasure nor surprise
      when we included her in the prevailing <i>tu</i>. She had a quiet, sweet,
      English voice; an extremely delicate complexion, pale rose merging into
      lily-white (which we, I dare say, assumed was due to a scientific
      management of rouge and powder); a pair of large gray eyes; a lot of
      waving warm-brown hair; and a face so smooth of contour, so soft and fine
      in texture, that one might have thought her a mere girl of eighteen,&mdash;or
      twenty at the utmost,&mdash;whereas, in point of fact, as we learned later
      on, she was twenty-three.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this first evening of her arrival, however, neophyte though she was, we
      observed her with no special care, paid her no special attention, nor felt
      any special curiosity regarding her. Ladies of the quality we tacitly
      ascribed to her were such an old, old story for us; familiarity had bred
      apathy; we took her for granted very much as we might have taken for
      granted an addition to the number of chairs in the room. Besides, an
      attitude of <i>nil-admirari</i> towards all things, and particularly
      towards all things new, is the fashion of the Quarter; an attitude of
      torpid omniscience, of world-weary sophistication. We have seen
      everything, dissected everything, satisfied ourselves that stuffed with
      sawdust. We are <i>fin-de-siecle</i>, we are <i>décadents</i>, and we are
      Anglomaniacs to a man. To evince surprise at anything, therefore, or more
      than a supremely languid interest in anything, is what, when we are on our
      guard, most of us would die rather than do. Hence the questions that we
      put to Miss were few, desultory, superficial, and served in no wise to
      correct our misappreciation of her; whilst, together with the affirmative
      propositions that we laid down, they pre-supposed a point of view and a
      past experience similar to our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zélie, for example, asked her roundly (as one of a trade to another): &ldquo;<i>Tu
      cherches un callage, hein? On fais l&rsquo;indépendante?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss looked a little puzzled, but answered tentatively, &ldquo;<i>Non, pas
      college. Je suis artiste</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereat one or two of us stared, thinking it meaningless; one or two
      smiled, thinking it doubly-meaning; but the majority heeded it not; and no
      one paused to consider the depths of ignorance (unless, indeed, ignorance
      of the French language) that the reply might indicate. I should perhaps
      add that with us the young ladies who dance at Bullier&rsquo;s, sing at the <i>concerts
      apéritifs</i>, or serve in the <i>brasseries-à-femmes</i>, style
      themselves <i>artistes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the dinner, when the stuff that Madame Bourdon
      euphemistically calls coffee was brought in, we all broke out in loud
      accord with a song that time-honoured custom has prescribed for the event
      and moment. We are never treated to this beverage at the Hôtel de l&rsquo;.céan
      et de Shakespere, except on the advent of a <i>nouveau</i> or a <i>nouvelle</i>,
      when it is charged to his or her account; and here is the salute with
      which we hail it:&mdash;

      This atrocious doggerel, with its false rhymes and impossible quantities,
      its bad puns and equivocal suggestions, we sang straight through, at the
      tops of our voices; and Mademoiselle Miss listened smiling. How were we to
      know that she hadn&rsquo;t the faintest inkling of what it was all about, and
      that her smile betokened nothing deeper than pleasure in our high spirits
      and amusement at our vociferous energy? By and by she rose from the table,
      wished us a polite good-evening, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it was on the next night that we made up a party to go to
      Bruant&rsquo;s, in the Boulevard Rochechouart; and Zélie, moved by an impulse of
      kindness, turned to Miss, and proposed that she should join us. Miss asked
      what Bruant&rsquo;s was; and Zélie answered vaguely, &ldquo;<i>Comment, tu ne sais
      pas? Tant mieux, alors. Tu vas voir.</i>&rdquo; And Miss retired to put on her
      bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank goodness, if her acquaintance with French was slight, her
      acquaintance with the jargon talked and chanted at the Cabaret du Mirliton
      was null. Otherwise, she must always have remembered her visit there with
      pain and humiliation, and she could never have forgiven us for allowing
      her to make one of our expedition. As a matter of fact, however, she is
      able to recall the occasion as that of a singularly jolly little
      adventure, and is entirely unaware of the blame that we deserved.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      wherewith ladies crossing the threshold of Bruant&rsquo;s establishment are
      welcomed, Miss only smiled in a dazed way, never dreaming, I suppose, that
      it was meant for her and her companions, but fancying that we had entered
      in the middle of a noisy chorus. Then, when we had secured places, and
      ordered our bocks, I dare say she employed a few minutes in glancing round
      her, and receiving a general impression of the queer little room,&mdash;with
      its dark colouring, its profuse jumble of ornaments and paintings, its
      precious old Fifteenth Century fireplace, its giant <i>mirliton</i>
      suspended from the ceiling, its dubious clients, and its improbable
      orderer and master, handsome, brigandish-looking Aristide, in his scarlet
      neck-cloth, his patent-leather riding-boots and corduroy knickerbockers:
      all visible through an atmosphere rendered opalescent by candlelight
      struggling with cigarette-smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bruants, as everybody knows, it is against the rules to call a spade a
      spade; you must find a stronger name for it, and reserve the comparatively
      inoffensive &ldquo;spade&rdquo; for some such mild implement as a teaspoon. This is
      among Aristide&rsquo;s numerous dainty methods of certifying his scorn for the
      shifty refinements of modern life; and besides, for reasons that are not
      obvious, he thinks it&rsquo;s funny, and expects people to laugh. So, when
      presently he swaggered up to our little group of peaceable art-students,
      slapping our shoulders with violent good-fellowship, he must needs hail us
      as <i>mes mufles, mes cochons, et cetera</i>; and we of course had to
      approve ourselves no milksops by smiling delightedly. Then he lowered his
      voice, and told us he was in great distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no piano-banger. The cut-purse who usually does for me has sent word
      that he&rsquo;s laid up. Any of these chits here know how to thump the ivories?&rdquo;&mdash;chits
      being rather a liberal translation of the term that he employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chit yourself!&rdquo; cried Zélie, playfully. &ldquo;<i>Vieux chien!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you play the piano?&rdquo; Chalks asked in English of Mademoiselle Miss.
      &ldquo;Bruant wants somebody to play his accompaniments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can play a little. I could try,&rdquo; she answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Bruant led her to the instrument, where she sat with her back to the
      company, and worked hard for its entertainment, till, in about an hour,
      the delinquent pianist turned up, apparently recovered from his
      indisposition, and took her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what were we to make of this? A young woman going to Bruants (than
      which there is scarcely a shadier resort in all the shady by-ways of
      Bohemia)&mdash;going to Bruant&rsquo;s for the first time in her life, boldly
      gets up, and takes part in the performance! How were we to penetrate
      beneath the surface of her conduct, and perceive the world of innocence,
      the supreme unconsciousness of evil, that lay hidden there, and accounted
      for it? Bruant himself, to our shame be it owned,&mdash;rough, ribald,
      rowdy Aristide,&mdash;saw what we were blind to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the devil does <i>she</i> come to be knocking about with your flash
      mob?&rdquo; he asked me, in the pauses of one of his songs; he struts hither and
      thither through the room, as he sings, you know and exchanges
      parenthetical remarks with everybody. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no fit pals for the likes of
      her, <i>vous autres, b&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, m&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;words
      that would put any English printing-machinery out of gear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I queried meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s an honest girl, that&rsquo;s all. She&rsquo;s fallen among thieves, and
      I believe she doesn&rsquo;t know it. You oughtn&rsquo;t to have brought her to a <i>sale
      trou</i> like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bring her. She came of her own free will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s some ridiculous mistake, mark what I&rsquo;m telling you.&rdquo; And he
      moved off singing the second stanza of &ldquo;Saint Lazare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the arrival of his own paid pianist, he conducted Miss back to her
      seat at our table, made her a grand bow, thanked her in a speech every
      word of which could have been found in the Academy Dictionary, and
      insisted upon her drinking a <i>galopin</i> of beer with him, and clinking
      glasses. She laughed and blushed a good deal; but it was plain that in her
      heart she was murmuring, &ldquo;What fun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards we went to the Rat Mort for supper. Yes, heaven forgive us, we
      took Mademoiselle Miss to the Rat Mort for supper!
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing, in recalling those early days, I catch myself perpetually
      thanking our stars for, with a joy the obverse of a terror; and that is
      that it was mercifully given to us to find her out before she had a chance
      to do the same by us. Otherwise,&mdash;if we had persisted a little longer
      in our error, and in our consequent modes of speech and conduct, and she
      had come to understand,&mdash;my heart quails to picture the hurt and
      mortification she would have suffered, the contempt and horror she must
      have felt for us. But, by a good fortune that we had certainly done
      nothing to deserve, our eyes were opened to her true colours in the very
      nick of time; and we made haste to turn over a new leaf before she had
      been able to spell out the old. I can hardly tell just how it began. It
      began probably in vague misgivings, dim surmises, that gradually waxed
      stronger and clearer, and were in the end confirmed by circumstances.
      Little questions she would ask, little comments she would make, little
      things she would do, struck us as odd, as hopeless to explain,&mdash;unless
      on an hypothesis that at first seemed quite too far-fetched, but by-and-by
      forced itself upon us as the only one that would in any way fit the case;
      the hypothesis, namely, of her stupendous innocence; that, indeed, as
      Bruant had divined, her presence with us was due to some preposterous
      misconception; that, in her own perfect soundness and honesty, she was
      totally unsuspicious of the corruption round about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chalks used to give expression to this growing sentiment of ours, by
      shaking his head, looking half wise, half mystified, and muttering,
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something queer about that girl. I&rsquo;ll be gol-donged if I can make
      her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once for instance, she confided to us that she thought Madame Bourdon must
      be a very religious person, because she was always with a priest. It was
      clear that she proffered this remark in entire literalness and good faith,
      with no ulterior intention of any sort; and we, after staring at it for a
      minute or two, reflected upon it for a fortnight. True enough, the black
      robe of Monsieur the Abbé did lend a meretricious air of orthodoxy both to
      Madame and to her establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the fact came out, I can&rsquo;t remember how, that she was working at
      Julian&rsquo;s,&mdash;taking &ldquo;whole days,&rdquo; too, which means nine or ten hours of
      heavy labour in the pestilential air of a studio packed with people, where
      every window is shut, and the temperature hovers between eighty and ninety
      Fahrenheit. Why should she be breaking her back and poisoning her lungs at
      Julian&rsquo;s, if&mdash;-?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something queer about her,&rdquo; Chalks insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was always extremely friendly, though, with the other ladies of our
      household: visited them in their rooms, received them in her own, walked
      out with them, chatted with them as freely as her French would let her;
      and this confused us, and deferred our better judgment. It was hard to
      believe that anybody, no matter how guileless, nor how ill-instructed in
      their idiom, could rub elbows much with Zélie, Yvonne, Fifine, and not
      become more or less distinctly aware of the peculiarities of their
      temperament. If actions speak louder than words, manners nowadays are
      masters of seven languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, one afternoon, in the garden of the Luxembourg, Miss asked of me,
      &ldquo;Are they all married, those young ladies at our hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her for a moment in a sort of stupefaction. Was it her
      pleasure to be jocular? No, she had spoken in utmost sobriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married?&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;What on earth made you think they&rsquo;re married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody calls them Madame. I thought in French Madame was only used for
      married women, like Mrs. with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some providential instinct in me bade me respect her simplicity, and
      answer with a prevarication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;not in the Latin Quarter, at any rate. It&rsquo;s the custom
      here to call all women Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she proceeded with swift logic, &ldquo;why do they call me
      Mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was rather a &ldquo;oner,&rdquo; but I came up manfully. &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      because you&rsquo;re English, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she murmured, apparently accepting the reason as sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I ventured to sound her a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like them, you find them pleasant, the girls at the hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I like them,&rdquo; she answered deliberately. &ldquo;Of course, their ways
      aren&rsquo;t quite English, are they? But I suppose one must expect French girls
      to be different. They seem intelligent and good-natured, and they&rsquo;ve been
      very nice to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you don&rsquo;t always understand each other?&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no. That is what prevents our being intimate. French is so
      difficult, and they talk so fast. It&rsquo;s as much as I can do to understand
      the masters at the school, though they speak very slowly and clearly,
      because they know I&rsquo;m English. But I think I&rsquo;m learning a little. I can
      understand a great deal more than I could when I first came. Do all French
      girls smoke cigarettes? I knew that Spanish and Russian women did, but I
      didn&rsquo;t know it was the custom in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, decidedly,&rdquo; I said to myself,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chalks is right. There&rsquo;s something &lsquo;queer,&rsquo; about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But how to reconcile the theory of her &ldquo;queerness&rdquo; with the fact of her
      residence here alone among us in the Latin Quarter of Paris? Assuming her
      to be a well brought-up, innocent young English girl, how in the name of
      verisimilitude had she contrived to get so far astray from her natural
      orbit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, in the teeth of difficulties, the theory gained ground. And
      as it did so, it was amusing to note the way in which the other girls
      accepted it. They were thoroughly scandalized, poor dears. Their sense of
      propriety bridled up in indignant astonishment. So long as they had been
      able to reckon Miss, simply and homogeneously, a case of total depravity,&mdash;a
      specimen of the British variety of their own species,&mdash;they had
      placed no stint upon their affable commendation of her. She was <i>pas
      mal, très bien, très gentille, très comme il faut</i>, even <i>très chic</i>.
      But directly the suspicion began to work in their minds that perhaps,
      after all, appearances had been misleading, and she might prove an
      entirely vertical member of society,&mdash;then perforce they had to wag
      their heads over her, and cry fie at her goings-on. What! how! a
      respectable unmarried woman,&mdash;a <i>demoiselle, du monde,&mdash;a
      jeune fille bien élevie</i>,&mdash;come by herself to Paris,&mdash;dwell
      unchaperoned in the Hôtel de l&rsquo;.céan et de Shakespere,&mdash;hob and nob
      familiarly with you and me,&mdash;submit to be <i>tutoyée</i> by Tom,
      Dick, and Harry! <i>Mais, allons donc</i>, it was really quite too
      shameless. And they played my ladies Steyne and Bareacres to her
      inadequate Rebecca; looked askance at her when she came into the room,
      drew in their precious skirts when they had to pass her, gathered in
      corners to discuss her, and were, in fine, profoundly and sincerely
      shocked. For, here below, there are no sterner moralists, no more
      punctilious sticklers for the prunes and prisms of conventionality, than
      those harmful, unnecessary cats, the Zélies and the Germaines of the <i>Quartier-Latin.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mai&rsquo;s, enfin, si c&rsquo;est vrai,&mdash;si elle est réellement comme, ça,
      nest-ce pas,&mdash;mais c&rsquo;est une honte,</i>&rdquo; was one of their refrains;
      and &ldquo;<i>Elle manque complètement de pudeur alors</i>,&rdquo; was another; to
      which the chorus: &ldquo;<i>Oh, pour sur!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And poor little Miss couldn&rsquo;t understand it. Observing the frigid and
      austere reserve with which they met her, feeling their half suppressed
      disapproval in the atmosphere, she searched her conscience vainly to
      discover what she could have done to anger them, and was, for a time I
      fear, exceedingly unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We men, meanwhile, were cursing ourselves for blockheads, chewing the
      sharp cud of repentance, and trying in a hundred sheepish, clumsy fashions
      to make amends. It would have been diverting for an outsider to have
      watched us; the deference with which we spoke and listened to her, the
      interest we took in her work, the infinite little politenesses we paid
      her. When all is said, the sins we were guilty of towards her had been
      chiefly metaphysical; it was what we had thought, rather than what we had
      done. But I don&rsquo;t know that our contrition was on this account any the
      less acute; we had thought such a lot. We fancied a sister of our own in
      her position, and we conceived a frantic desire to punch the heads of the
      men who should have dared to think of her as we, quite nonchalantly and
      with no sense of daring, had thought of Miss. Our biggest positive
      transgression was the latitude of speech we had allowed ourselves at the
      table d&rsquo;hôte; and the effect of that was happily neutralised (no thanks to
      us) by the poverty of her French. But, though our salvation lay in the
      circumstance, I am far from sure that it did not aggravate our remorse. We
      were profiting by her limitations, taking sanctuary in her ignorance; and
      that smacked disagreeably of the sneakish.

      Our yearning to make amends was singularly complicated by the necessity we
      were under, as much for her sake as for our own, to prevent her ever
      guessing how (or even that) we had offended. Not to confess is to shirk
      the better half of atonement; yet confession in this case was impossible,
      concealment was imperative. That, if she should get so much as a glimmer
      of the truth, it would blast us forever in her esteem, was a
      consideration, but a trifling one to the thought of what her emotions must
      be like to realise the sort of place she had lately held in ours. No, she
      must never guess. With the consciousness in our hearts that we had
      practised a kind of intellectual foul play upon her, and in our minds a
      vivid picture of the different footing things would be on if she only
      knew, we must continue cheerfully to enjoy her smiles and her good graces,
      and try to look as if we felt that we deserved them. It was bare-faced
      hypocrisy, it was a game of false pretences; but it was Hobson&rsquo;s choice.
      We could not even cease to thee-and-thou her, lest she should wonder at
      the change, and from wonderment proceed to ratiocination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing we must do, though,&rdquo; said Chalks, &ldquo;we must get her out of this
      so-called hotel. Blamed if I can guess how she ever came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was before we had found the guidebook in her room, long before we had
      heard her simple story, which explained everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve acted like a pack of hounds, that&rsquo;s my opinion,&rdquo; Chalks went on.
      &ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ve got to step up to the captain&rsquo;s office and settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His rhetoric was confused, but I dare say we caught the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been acting like a pack of poodles latterly,&rdquo; somebody put in,
      &ldquo;following her about, fawning at her feet, fetching and carrying for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and hadn&rsquo;t we oughter?&rdquo; demanded Chalks. &ldquo;Is there any gentleman
      here who doesn&rsquo;t like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I only mentioned the circumstance as a source of unction,&rdquo; said
      the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chalks is right. We must get her out of the hotel,&rdquo; Campbell agreed. &ldquo;She
      mustn&rsquo;t be exposed any longer to contact with those little beasts of
      Mimis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, but how are we to manage it?&rdquo; inquired Norton. &ldquo;We
      can&rsquo;t give her the word to move, without saying why. And as I understand
      it, that&rsquo;s precisely the last thing we wish to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to get her out of the mud, without letting her know she&rsquo;s in it,&rdquo;
       said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the devil of it,&rdquo; admitted Chalks. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo;
       he added, with an air of inspiration. &ldquo;Why not work it from the other end
      round? Get rid of the Mimis, and let Miss stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This proposition was so radical, so revolutionary, we were inclined to
      greet it with derision. But Chalks stood by his guns. &ldquo;How to do it?&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;Why, boycott &lsquo;em. Make this shop too hot to hold &lsquo;em. Cultivate
      the art of <i>being infernally disagreeable</i>. They&rsquo;ll clear out fast
      enough. Then there&rsquo;d be no harm in Miss staying till the end of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll Madame say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we can fill their places up with fellows. I&rsquo;ll go touting among the
      men at the school. Easy enough to bag a half a dozen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about Lucile?&rdquo;&mdash;Lucile, it will be remembered, was Madame&rsquo;s
      niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; confessed Chalks, dashed for a moment. &ldquo;Lucile&rsquo;s the snag.
      But I guess on the whole Lucile will have to go too. I&rsquo;ll hire a man I
      know to want her room. Madame won&rsquo;t let family feeling stand in the way of
      trade. Especially the sky-pilot won&rsquo;t, not he. And I&rsquo;d like to know who&rsquo;s
      the boss of this shebang, if not Monsieur the Abbé? There&rsquo;s no love lying
      around loose between him and Lucile, as it stands. Just let a man turn up
      and ask for her room, Madame&rsquo;ll drop her like a hot potato.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But from the labour of putting such schemes in operation we were saved by
      a microbe: a mouse can serve a lion. Half of our male contingent went down
      with the influenza: and our ladies, Lucile included, incontinently fled
      the ship. They dreaded the infection; and the house was as melancholy as a
      hospital; and noise being inhibited, they couldn&rsquo;t properly entertain
      their friends. Besides, I think they were glad enough of an occasion to
      escape from the proximity of Miss. She had infused an element of ozone
      into our moral atmosphere; their systems weren&rsquo;t accustomed to it; it
      filled them with a vague <i>malaise</i>: they made a break for fouler air.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was at this crisis that Miss came out strong. She laid aside all
      business and excuses, and constituted herself our nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long, and very nearly all night long too, she was at it: flying
      from room to room, administering medicines to this man, reading aloud to
      that, spraying eucalyptus everywhere, running for the doctor when somebody
      appeared to have taken a turn for the worse,&mdash;in short, heaping coals
      of fire upon our heads with a lavish, untiring hand. When we got up from
      our sick-beds, every mother&rsquo;s son of us was dead in love with her. From
      that time to the end she went about like a queen with her body-guard; and
      there wasn&rsquo;t one of us who wouldn&rsquo;t have given his life to spare her a
      pain in the little finger; and our rewards were her smiles. It is to be
      noted that she accepted our devotion with the same calm unconsciousness of
      anything extraordinary that she had shown in the old days to our doubtful
      courtesy. She wore her crown and wielded her gentle sceptre like one in
      the purple born, whilst her subjects outdid each other in zeal to please
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime we had learned her previous history; we had pieced it together
      from a multitude of little casual utterances. Her father, some five years
      ago, had died a bankrupt; and she had gone as governess with an English
      family to the far West of America, where they had a cattle ranch; and now
      she was on her way home, to seek a new engagement; and she was breaking
      her pilgrimage with a season of art in Paris (she had always wanted to
      cultivate her natural gift for painting); and she had chosen the Hôtel de
      l&rsquo;.céan et de Shakespere because her guide-book recommended it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Norton had a sister married to a squire in Derbyshire; and one day
      this good lady advertised in the <i>Times</i> for a governess; and Miss,
      who kept watch on such advertisements (going to Neal&rsquo;s library to study
      the English papers), was on the point of answering it, when Norton cut in
      with a &ldquo;Let me write that letter for you. Mrs. Clere happens to be my
      sister.&rdquo; Of course Miss got the place; and it was to take it, and begin
      her duties, that she left us last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I follow her in fancy upon her journey, and imagine her arrival at the
      big, respectable, dull country house; and I wonder will she regret a
      little and think fondly now and then of Madame Bourdon&rsquo;s hotel and the
      ragged staff of comrades she has left behind her here. For the present the
      Rue Racine is an abhorrent vacuum, and I am sick with nostagia for the
      Paris of yesterday.

      the sensation that besets an ordinary man on entering a familiar room,
      where, during his absence, some change has been made?&mdash;a piece of
      furniture moved, an old hanging taken down, a new picture put up?&mdash;that
      teasing sense of strangeness, which, if subordinate to the business of the
      moment, yet persists, uncomfortably formless, till, for instance, the
      presiding genius of the place inquires, &ldquo;How do you like the way we have
      moved the piano?&rdquo; or something else happens to crystallise the sufferer&rsquo;s
      mere vague feeling into a perception; after which his spirit may be at
      rest again?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I woke this morning, here in my own dingy furnished room, in this
      most dingy lodging-house, I had an experience very like that I mean to
      suggest: something seemed wrong and unusual, something had been changed
      overnight. This was the more perplexing, because my door had remained
      locked and bolted ever since I had tucked myself into bed; and <i>within</i>
      the room, after all, there isn&rsquo;t much to change; only the bed itself, and
      the armoire, and my writing-table, and my wash-hand-stand, and my two
      dilapidated chairs; and these were still where they belonged. So were the
      shabby green window-curtains, the bilious green paper on the walls, the
      dismal green baldaquin above my head. Nevertheless, a tantalising sense of
      something changed, of something taken away, of an unwonted vacancy,
      haunted me through the brewing and the drinking of my coffee, and through
      the first few whiffs of my cigarette. Then I put on my hat, and &ldquo;went to
      school,&rdquo; and forgot about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I came back, in the afternoon, I found that whatever the cause
      might be of my curious psychical disturbance, it had not ceased to act. No
      sooner had I got seated at my table, and begun to arrange my notes, than
      down upon me settled, stronger if possible than ever, that inexplicable
      feeling of emptiness in the room, of strangeness, of an accustomed
      something <i>gone</i>. What could it mean? It was disquieting,
      exasperating; it interfered with my work. I must investigate it, and put
      an end to it, if I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just at that moment the current of my ideas was temporarily turned by
      somebody rapping on my door. I called out, &ldquo;<i>Entrez!</i>&rdquo; and there
      entered a young lady: a young lady in black, with soiled yellow ribbons,
      and on her cheeks a little artificial bloom. The effect of this, however,
      was mitigated by a series of flesh-colored ridges running through it; and
      as the young person&rsquo;s eyes, moreover, were red and humid, I concluded that
      she had been shedding tears. I looked at her for two or three seconds
      without being able to think who she was; but before she had pronounced her
      &ldquo;<i>B&rsquo;jour, monsieur</i>,&rdquo; I remembered: Madame Germaine, the friend of
      poor little Zizi, my next-door neighbour. And then, in a flash, the reason
      appeared to me for my queer dim feeling of something not as usual in my
      surroundings, <i>I had not heard Zizi cough!</i> That was it! Zizi, the
      poor little girl in the adjoining room,&mdash;behind that door against
      which my armoire stands,&mdash;who for three months past has scarcely left
      the house, but has coughed, coughed, coughed perpetually: so that every
      night I have fallen asleep, and every morning wakened, and every day
      pursued my indoor occupations, to that distressing sound. Oh, our life is
      not all cakes and ale, here in the Quarter; we have our ennuis, as well as
      the rest of mankind; and when we are too poor to change our lodgings, we
      must be content to abide in patience&mdash;whatever sounds our neighbours
      choose to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, so it came to pass that the sight of Madame Germaine, in
      her soiled finery, cleared up my problem for me: Zizi had not coughed. And
      I said to myself, &ldquo;Ah, the poor little thing is better, and is spending
      the day out of doors.&rdquo; (It has been a lovely day, soft as April, though in
      midwinter; and my inference, therefore, was not overdrawn.) &ldquo;And Madame
      Germaine,&rdquo; I proceeded rapidly, &ldquo;has come to see her; and finding her
      away, has looked in on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile my visitor stood still, just within the threshold, and gazed
      solemnly, almost reproachfully, at me with her big protruding eyes: eyes
      that, protruding always far more than enough, seemed now, swollen by
      recent weeping, fairly ready to leave their sockets. What had she been
      crying for, I wondered. Then I began our conversation with a cheery &ldquo;Zizi
      isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ah, m&rsquo;sieu! Ah, la pauv&rsquo; Zizi!&rdquo;!</i> was her response, in a sort of
      hysterical gasp; and two fresh tears rolled down her cheeks, making
      further havoc of her rouge. She took a few steps forward, and sank into my
      arm-chair. &ldquo;<i>La pauv&rsquo; petite!</i>&rdquo; she sobbed, I was puzzled, of course,
      and a little troubled. &ldquo;What is it? What is the matter?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Zizi
      isn&rsquo;t worse, surely? I haven&rsquo;t heard her cough all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, m&rsquo;sieu, she isn&rsquo;t worse. Oh, no, she&mdash;she is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t need to recount any more of my interview with Madame Germaine,
      though it lasted a good half-hour longer, and was sufficiently vivacious.
      I can&rsquo;t describe to you the shock her announcement caused me, nor the
      chill and despondency that have been growing on me ever since. Zizi&mdash;dead?
      Zizi and Death!&mdash;the notions are too awfully incongruous. I look at
      the door that separates our rooms,&mdash;the door athwart which, in former
      times, I have heard so many bursts of laughter, snatches of song, when
      Zizi would be entertaining her&mdash;&mdash;she called them &ldquo;friends;&rdquo;
       and, latterly, that hacking, unyielding cough of hers,&mdash;I look at the
      door, and a sort of cold and blackness seems to creep in from its edges;
      and then I fancy the darkened chamber beyond it, with the open window, and
      Zizi&rsquo;s little form stretched on the bed, stark and dead,&mdash;poor little
      chirping, chattering, ribald Zizi! Oh, it is ghastly. And all her
      trumpery, twopenny fripperies round about her, their occupation gone: her
      sham jewels, and her flounces, and her tawdry furs and laces, and her
      powder-puffs and rouge-pots&mdash;though it was only towards the end that
      Zizi took to rouge. It is as if they were to tell you that a <i>doll</i>
      is dead: can such things <i>die?</i> They are not wholly inhuman, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      They have viscera? are made of real flesh and blood? can experience real
      pains? and&mdash;and die? Here are you and I, serious folk, not without
      some sense of the solemnity and mystery of God&rsquo;s creation, here are we
      still working the first degree of our arcana,&mdash;Life; and yonder lies
      that tinselled little gewgaw, admitted to the second! She has passed the
      dread portals, she has accomplished the miracle of Death! She was vain and
      shallow and hard: she was malicious: she was shameless in her speech as in
      her conduct: she was lively, it is true, and merry-mannered, and pretty:
      but she had no affections, no illusions, no remorse; and lies dropped like
      toads from her mouth whenever she opened it: yet she is dead! And
      to-morrow women (who would have shrunk from her in her lifetime, as from
      something pestilential) will reverently cross themselves, and men (who
      would have.... ah, well, it is best not to remember what the men would
      have done) will decently bare their heads, as her poor coffin is borne
      through the streets on its way to the graveyard. Isn&rsquo;t it ghastly? Isn&rsquo;t
      it quite enough to depress a fellow, to sober him up, when there is only a
      thin partition, broken by a door, to separate him from such a
      death-chamber?&mdash;Wait; I must tell you something about Zizi, as I have
      known her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before our personal acquaintance began I used to see her here and
      there in the Quarter: at the Bullier balls, or the Café Vachette, or in
      the Luxembourg or the Boule-Miche when the weather was fine: and to admire
      her as a singularly inoffensive specimen of her class. Those were her
      palmy days. Her &ldquo;friend&rdquo; was a student of law, from the Quartier Marbouf,
      with a pocketful of money and a pointed beard. She was the smallest of
      possible little women, no higher than her law-student&rsquo;s heart, if he had
      one; and he was only a medium-sized Frenchman. She was very daintily
      formed, with fine hands and feet; she had a great quantity of black hair,
      and a pair of bright black eyes. Her face was pale, and decidedly an
      interesting face: pert, if you please, and tremendously mischievous, but
      suggestive of wit, of intelligence, even of humour and passion: a most
      uncommon face, with character in it,&mdash;I believe I may even say with
      distinction. It was a face you would have noticed anywhere, to wonder who
      and what its owner might be. And then she used to dress very well, very
      quietly: in refined grays or blacks: there was absolutely nothing in her
      dress to betray her place in the world&rsquo;s economy: passing her in the
      street, you would have taken her for an entirely irreproachable little
      housewife, with an unusually interesting face. I used to see her in all
      the pleasure-resorts of the Quarter, ami to admire her, and speculate
      about her in a languid, melancholy way. Then I left town for the summer;
      and when I came back last September I established myself here in the Hôtel
      du Saint Esprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first morning after my arrival I was awakened by queer but unambiguous
      noises coming through that door, there behind my armoire; a strident
      laugh, and a few hardy exclamations, that could leave me in no doubt as to
      the sex and quality of my fellow-lodger. An hour or two later I
      encountered Zizi on the landing; and the concierge informed me that she
      was the tenant of the next room to my own. Such a neighbourship would
      horrify you in London or New York: but we think nothing of accidents much
      worse than that, here in the Latin Quarter of Paris. Afterwards, night and
      morning, and more especially in those small hours that are properly both
      or neither, I would hear Zizi&rsquo;s laughter beyond our dividing door; her
      laughter, or her thin little voice raised in a stupid song, or the murmur
      of light talk, that would sometimes leap to the pitch of anger, for I
      suspect that Zizi&rsquo;s temper was uncertain; and then, rare at first, but
      recurring more and more frequently, till it became quite the dominant
      note, her hard, dry, racking little cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elinor was in Paris about this time. To my great joy, she had come to pass
      the autumn, and perhaps the winter too; and she was very anxious that I
      should show her something of the seamy side of life here. She had taken
      lodgings on the other&mdash;the right and wrong&mdash;bank of the river;
      and every afternoon, my day&rsquo;s work done, I would join her there, and we
      would go off together for little excursions into Bohemia. I happened to be
      extraordinarily flush for the moment; I had nearly two hundred pounds of
      ready money; and this was a help. Of course I took her to the Moulin
      Rouge, which disgusted her, as I had warned her that it would; and to the
      Chat Noir, which amused her; and I was fortunate enough to get two seats
      for a performance at the Théâtre Libre, which both amused and disgusted
      her at once; and I introduced her to the jerry-built splendours of
      Bullier; and we took long delightful walks together in the Luxembourg,
      where she would feed the sparrows with crumbs of unnutritious bread; and
      we lunched, dined, and supped together in an infinite number of droll
      restaurants; and now and then we went slumming in the far north, or east,
      or south; and Pousset&rsquo;s knew us, and Vachette&rsquo;s; and sometimes,&rsquo; for the
      fun or the convenience of the thing, we would drop in among the <i>demi-gomme</i>
      of the Café de la Paix: and she would have been altogether happy and
      contented save for a single unfulfilled desire. She wanted to make
      acquaintance with some member of the sisterhood of <i>Sainte Grisette</i>;
      she wanted, as a literary woman, to see what such an one would be like; to
      convince herself whether or not they were as black as I had painted them,
      for I had painted them very black indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said at last, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be sorry for it, but since you won&rsquo;t take
      no for an answer, I&rsquo;ll see what can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then one afternoon I was waiting for her by appointment, in that very Café
      de la Paix, when whom should I see enter, and ensconce themselves in a
      back room, but my neighbour Zizi, and her friend of the ribbons, Madame
      Germaine. &ldquo;When Elinor arrives,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;and if her heart is still set
      on that sort of thing, I will introduce Zizi to her: for Zizi is as nearly
      innocuous as a microbe of her variety very well can be.&rdquo; Elinor arrived a
      moment later: beautiful, strong, gracious, and pure as a May morning: and
      I proposed the measure to her; and her instant decision was, &ldquo;Oh, yes, by
      all means.&rdquo; So she and I penetrated into the backroom, and took the table
      next to Zizi&rsquo;s; and presently Zizi gave me a sly little covert glance and
      smile; and therewith I invited her and her companion to come and sit with
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame permits?&rdquo; demanded Zizi, raising her eyebrows, astonished at such
      magnanimity on the part of a fellow-woman. Elinor smiled assent; and the
      two <i>étudiantes</i> rose and placed themselves before our own slab of
      marble. I asked them what they would take; of course they commanded each a
      <i>menthe à l&rsquo;eau.</i> But though I tried to suit the conversation to
      their taste and level, they were not perfectly at ease. The presence of
      Elinor, whom, for all that she was alone with a man in the Café de la
      Paix, they could perceive with half an eye to be a bird of a totally
      different feather to their own, embarrassed them a good deal. Their desire
      to appear well before her, their determined best behaviour, tied their
      tongues, and made them surpassingly dull; for when they are not flavoured
      lavishly with Gallic salt, they are unimaginably insipid, these little
      soubrettes in the comedy of evil. However, before we broke up, I had
      engaged them to breakfast with us on the Sunday to follow. We were all to
      meet at Fousset&rsquo;s in the Boulevard at noon, and thence we would proceed to
      the Abbaye de Thélème, where I would bespeak a <i>cabinet particulier</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbaye de Thélème is the riskiest of restaurants in a most risky
      quarter: but Elinor wanted to see the seamy side of Parisian life, and I
      was resolved to satisfy her once for all with a drastic measure of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Voyez-vous</i>,&rdquo; I heard Zizi boasting to her, in a whisper, &ldquo;it is
      forbidden for women to come alone to this café. But I am an honest girl.
      The <i>gérant</i> knows me. They make no objection to me or to my friends.
      <i>Adieu, madame. Au revoir, proche</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;this last to me. <i>Proche</i>,
      indeed! But in the Latin Quarter the word is often used as a substitute
      for <i>voisin</i>. Then Zizi took her small self off, followed by
      Germaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I queried, as soon as Elinor and I were alone, &ldquo;is your thirst for
      experience satisfied? Are you happy at last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am overcome with bewilderment. Who would have known that they weren&rsquo;t
      simply two ordinary bourgeoises? There wasn&rsquo;t anything rowdy or shocking
      about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! The rouge? The ribbons? The bulging eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that one. I didn&rsquo;t care much for her. Still,
      even she looked no worse than&mdash;well, a shop-girl. But the other, the
      little one. I shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised to meet her anywhere,&mdash;at
      Madame X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s, at Madame de Z&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;..
      She was dressed so quietly, in such good taste. Her manners were so
      subdued, almost English. And her face,&mdash;it&rsquo;s a face that would strike
      you anywhere. So delicate, refined, so quaint and interesting. <i>She</i>
      doesn&rsquo;t rouge. And such lovely hair! Oh, I am sure she is full of good
      qualities. What a shame and horror it is that... that... It makes one feel
      inclined to loathe your whole sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elinor&rsquo;s commentary at this point became a lamentation, which it would be
      irrelevant to repeat. &ldquo;I must get her to tell me her story,&rdquo; was its
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll tell you her story fast enough, only, I warn you, it will be a
      pack of lies. The truth isn&rsquo;t in them, those little puppets. Don&rsquo;t cherish
      any illusions about her. The most one can say for her is that she&rsquo;s a
      fairly harmless example of a desperately bad class. The grisette of
      Musset, of Henry Murger, exists no longer, even if she ever did exist.
      To-day Zizi was on her good behaviour. Sunday, I hope for the sake of
      science, she&rsquo;ll get off it, and be her wicked little self. Yes, her face
      is remarkable, but it&rsquo;s an absurd accident, a slip of nature: not one of
      the qualities it would seem to indicate is anywhere in her&mdash;neither
      wit nor humour nor emotion. She&rsquo;s just a little undersized cat; not a
      kitten: she has none of the innocent gentleness of a kitten: an
      undergrown, hard, sprightly little cat. However, she can be amusing enough
      when she&rsquo;s roused; and on Sunday we are likely to have a merry breakfast.&rdquo;
       But herein I proved myself a false prophet. We were still at the <i>hors
      d&rsquo;ouvres</i> when Zizi began to cry. She had coughed; and Elinor had asked
      her if she had a cold; and that question precipitated a flood of tears.
      This was dispiriting. It is always dispiriting to see one of these
      creatures anything but gay and flippant: serious feeling is so crudely, so
      garishly, at variance with your preconception of them, with the mood in
      which you approach them. And yet they cry a good deal,&mdash;mostly,
      however, tears of mere spite or vexed vanity; or, it may be, of hysteria,
      for they are frightfully subject to what they call <i>crises de nerfs</i>.
      But Zizi&rsquo;s tears now were of a different water. Had she a cold? Oh, no, it
      was worse than that. The doctor said her lungs were affected; and if she
      didn&rsquo;t speedily change her mode of life, she must go into a decline. And
      this, if you please, was the dish laid on our table, there in the vulgar
      <i>cabinet particulier</i> of that shady restaurant, under the crystal
      gasalier, and between the four diamond-scratched looking-glasses that
      covered the walls,&mdash;this was the dish served to us even before the
      oysters; and you may imagine, therefore, with what appetite we attacked
      the good things that came after. The doctor had told her that she must
      absolutely suspend her dissipations for at least a six-month, and rest,
      and <i>soigner</i> herself, and &ldquo;feed up,&rdquo; or she would surely become <i>poitrinaire</i>.
      &ldquo;And do nothing? How can I? <i>Faut vivre, parbleu!</i>&rdquo; Her present
      friend-in-chief, she explained, was at the School of Mines; his pension
      from his family only amounted to two hundred and fifty francs a month; he
      was all that is good, he would do his utmost for her; but she couldn&rsquo;t
      live on what he could spare her out of two hundred and fifty francs a
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this she went off in a regular fit of hysterics; and Elinor had her
      hands full, trying to bring her round. Hysterics are infectious; and
      Madame Germaine sat in her place, and sobbed helplessly,&mdash;not in
      sympathy, but by infection,&mdash;whilst her tears fell into her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that Elinor was tremendously distressed, and I cursed the
      misinspired moment when I had arranged this feast. &ldquo;Terrible, terrible!&rdquo;
       she murmured, shaking her head and looking at me with pained eyes. When at
      length Zizi was calm again, Elinor asked, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind if I speak with
      Monsieur in English?&rdquo; and then said to me, &ldquo;This is quite too dreadful. We
      must do something for her. We must save her from consumption; and perhaps
      at the same time we can redeem her, make a good woman of her. She has it
      in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I respected Elinor&rsquo;s sincerity too much to laugh at the utopian quality of
      her optimism: so I waived the latter of her remarks, and replied only to
      the former. &ldquo;I should be glad to do anything possible for her, but I don&rsquo;t
      exactly see what <i>is</i> possible. Besides, I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s
      threatened with consumption, any more than I am. This is a pose, to make
      herself interestingly pathetic in your eyes, and get some money. You&rsquo;ll
      see&mdash;she&rsquo;s going to strike me for fifty francs. It&rsquo;s the sum they
      usually ask for. And she wants to win your sanction to the gift
      beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surely enough, Zizi lifted up her tearful face, its features all puffed
      out and empurpled, and said at this very moment, in a whimper that ought
      to have hardened the softest heart, &ldquo;If Monsieur could give me a little
      money&mdash;a couple of louis&mdash;a fifty-franc note? I could buy
      medicines and things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said I, brutally; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d buy <i>chiffons</i> and things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed without offence, and gave me a knowing glance, but protested,
      &ldquo;<i>Non, sérieusement, je veux me soigner</i>.&rdquo; Then she turned to Elinor,
      and pleaded coaxingly, &ldquo;Madame, tell him to give me fifty francs&mdash;<i>pour
      me soigner</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Elinor replied; &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t give you fifty francs, but this is what he
      <i>will</i> do, what <i>we</i> will do. If you will obey the doctor&rsquo;s
      orders, send your friends about their business, and lead a perfectly
      regular life for the time being, we will undertake to see that you want
      for nothing during the next six months. After that, <i>nous verrons!</i>
      For the present, that is what we offer you: six months in which to give
      yourself every chance for a cure. Only, during those six months&mdash;<i>faut
      etre sage</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Zizi began to cry again; and, of course, she could do nothing
      less than accept Madame&rsquo;s proposition with some show of effusion: though I
      mistrusted the whole-heartedness of her acceptance; she would much rather
      have pocketed the fifty francs, and had done with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elinor and she fell to discussing sundry practical details. Good and
      abundant food, warm clothing, healthful lodgings: these were the three
      desiderata that Elinor prescribed. As for the last, Zizi assured us that
      she already had them&mdash;&ldquo;since I live in the same house as Monsieur,&rdquo;
       she explained, convincingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elinor was not convinced. &ldquo;Do your rooms face south?&rdquo; was the question
      she insisted on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Zizi, about the points of the compass, and such abstruse matters
      generally, had no more idea than I have of Sanskrit; yet, &ldquo;Oh, yes, my
      room gives to the noon,&rdquo; she answered, without turning a hair. &ldquo;And,
      anyhow, it is a very nice room.&mdash;Come and see,&rdquo; she added,
      impulsively. &ldquo;I should be charmed to show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it will be all right?&rdquo; Elinor asked of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no worse than the rest,&rdquo; I acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so we took a cab, and were driven to the Rue St. Jacques. Madame
      Germaine parted from us at the threshold of the eating-house. &ldquo;I have an
      engagement in the Parc Monceau,&rdquo; she informed us, in the candour of her
      heart. Zizi jeered at her a good deal as we drove across the town. &ldquo;Her
      ribbons&mdash;<i>hein?</i> Her goggle-eyes! Not at all <i>comme il faut</i>.
      But a brave girl. She loves me like a sister. Monsieur smiles. No, word of
      honour, it is not as you think.&rdquo; If I had thought as Zizi thought I
      thought, I shouldn&rsquo;t have smiled; but she, of course, couldn&rsquo;t be expected
      to understand that. &ldquo;Poor Germaine! Her real name is Gobbeau, Marthe
      Gobbeau. She is stupid and ugly, but she is good-natured,&rdquo; which was more,
      perhaps, than one could say with truth of her little critic. &ldquo;Her mother
      is an <i>ouvreuse</i> in the Théâtre de Belleville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her father?&rdquo; queried Elinor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father!&rdquo; cried Zizi, and she was about to continue, when it occurred
      to her to respect Elinor&rsquo;s unsophistication. She gave me a furtive wink,
      and said, gravely, &ldquo;Oh, her father lives in the twenty-first
      arrondissement.&rdquo; Elinor was not aware that the arrondissements of Paris
      number only twenty, and so she could not realise either the double meaning
      or the antiquity of this evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zizi&rsquo;s room was precisely like a thousand other rooms in the Latin
      Quarter, though rather more luxurious than most: much more so than mine,
      for example. To begin with, she had a carpet, her private property, a
      sober-hued Brussels carpet, that covered almost the entire floor; then she
      had four chairs, each practicable and reasonably fresh-looking; her bed
      was enriched by a counterpane of crimson silk, and crimson too were the
      hangings over it. The walls were decorated in the prevailing style of her
      class and epoch, with tambourines, toy trumpets, empty bonbon boxes, and
      so forth, hung from tin-tacks. But the chief impression that you got of
      the room was one of cleanliness and order: Zizi, still for all slips of
      hers, was French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very neat it is, how exquisitely neat,&rdquo; Elinor murmured, in evident
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zizi smiled complacently,&mdash;with what they call proper pride. &ldquo;<i>Pas
      mal, hein? Asses chic, eh?&rdquo;</i> she questioned, whilst her eyes snapped
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Elinor admitted, &ldquo;it is very nice, but&mdash;it looks due north.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she proceeded to develop her favourite hygienic thesis, to the effect
      that no one could keep well who lived in a room that had no sun, the
      application being that Zizi must change her quarters. To-morrow, Monday,
      she must find a room that really did &ldquo;give to the noon;&rdquo; and at three
      o&rsquo;clock we would meet her at the Vachette, and go with her to inspect it.
      Of course we were to pay the rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Elinor,&rdquo; I said, when we had taken leave of Zizi, &ldquo;I am sorry to
      discourage you, but your benevolent schemes will come to nothing. She
      won&rsquo;t change her lodgings, and she won&rsquo;t change her mode of life. We would
      much better have given her a little ready cash, and got rid of her. An
      endeavour to be respectable, if only <i>ad interim</i> as it were, would
      weary her too much. You rashly promised to see that she wanted for
      nothing. Can you see that she has plenty of excitement?&mdash;which is the
      breath of her nostrils. To-morrow she will draw back; she will tell you
      that on the whole she finds she can&rsquo;t accept your bigger offer, and will
      renew her request for fifty francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know you weren&rsquo;t, I should think you were a perfectly
      soulless cynic,&rdquo; was Elinor&rsquo;s rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, cynic or no cynic, I was right. Elinor, in agreeing to meet Zizi at
      Vachettes on the morrow, had forgotten a previous engagement, which she
      remembered afterwards; so I went to the rendezvous alone, charged,
      however, with full powers to act as I might deem best. Zizi was a
      quarter-hour late, but she didn&rsquo;t mind that, apparently; at any rate she
      vouchsafed no apology for having kept me waiting. She made haste to let me
      know that she couldn&rsquo;t possibly change her lodgings; she hadn&rsquo;t even
      looked for others: her mother wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it, for one thing; and then&mdash;her
      friends? They all have mothers, somehow or other, though the notion seems
      incongruous: yet I suppose it&rsquo;s only natural. Zizi&rsquo;s was a purple-faced
      old <i>sage femme</i> from the purlieus of &lsquo;Montmartre. She had taken
      counsel with her mother, she said, and her mother wouldn&rsquo;t hear of her
      changing her abode. And then&mdash;her friends? When they came to see her,
      and found that she had moved, they would be displeased; they wouldn&rsquo;t
      follow her up. Business is business, after all, but in our youth we were
      taught that friendship isn&rsquo;t. Anyhow, Zizi foresaw herself quite
      friendless if she moved. &ldquo;But my room is very well. If you and Madame want
      to support me, why not support me there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I echoed, rather feebly perhaps, Elinor&rsquo;s lecture on the advantages of
      sunlight; and in any case, I told her, desirous as Madame and I were to
      &ldquo;support her,&rdquo; we positively declined to permit ourselves that indulgence,
      unless she took a sunny room: what we really wished was to help her to get
      well; we were persuaded that she couldn&rsquo;t get well in a northern aspect;
      and we had no sort of eagerness to throw our money from the windows. It
      was pretty clear to me that she had begun to distrust our motives: such
      unaccustomed kindness, such reckless extravagance, bore on their face a
      suspicious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Et cette dame?</i>&rdquo; she queried. &ldquo;<i>Cette anglaise? Qu est-ce qu&rsquo;elle
      me veut? Elle est ta maîtresse, hein? Femme mariée, eh? Et toi, avec ton
      petit air Sainte-Nitouche, va!</i> I&rsquo;ll tell you what: give me some money,
      fifty francs, to buy medicines, to pay a doctor. Come on! Fifty francs&mdash;it
      isn&rsquo;t much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is, my dear,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a jolly lot, as you know very
      well. But still, if you prefer the part, when you might have the whole,
      that is your affair; and so I&rsquo;m going to give it to you. Only, mind, this
      will begin and end the whole transaction. We give you fifty francs, but we
      will never give you another penny.&rdquo; Then I smuggled a fifty-franc note
      into her pretty little hand,&mdash;smuggled it, so that the waiters and
      the other <i>consommateurs</i> shouldn&rsquo;t see.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Zizi was troubled by no such false shame. She smoothed the note out,
      and held it up to the light, scrutinising it rigorously. Having satisfied
      herself that it wasn&rsquo;t a counterfeit, she crammed it into a small silver
      purse, closed the purse with a snap, and buried it in an occult female
      pocket. At last she turned her face towards mine, and said, &ldquo;<i>T&rsquo;es bon,
      toi</i>. That will bring you luck. Kiss me.&rdquo; I suggested that the café was
      rather too public a place for kissing. The fifty-franc note radiated its
      genial warmth throughout her small frame, and she quite &ldquo;chippered up,&rdquo;
       and laughed and chatted with me very pleasantly. &ldquo;Why do you never come to
      see me,&mdash;since we live in the same house?&rdquo; she was good enough to
      ask. And she tried to pump me, in a naughty insinuating way, about Elinor,
      her benefactress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Zizi was launched upon her descent into Avernus. Her cough got worse
      and worse; her cheeks grew hollow, her whole face dragged-looking; her
      figure lost its elasticity. She took to rouge and powder, and introduced
      falsetto notes into her toilet. With her failing health, her friends began
      to fail her too: coughs and fevers and eyes unnaturally bright are
      disturbing elements, and put a strain on friendship. She had to seek for
      new ones, and was to be met with a good deal in the Boulevards. Whenever
      she spied Elinor and me on her horizon, she bore down upon us, and begged
      for money: and she was always spying us, always turning up; it seemed as
      if she must have dogged our footsteps. Thus you cast your bread upon the
      waters, and it comes back to you in the fulness of time. She was French,
      as I have remarked before: but she showed no discretion, and no respect
      for places or occasions. Not infrequently, therefore, her familiar
      hailings of us were embarrassing. By and by she acquired a light-hearted
      habit of entering the Vachette, ordering what she would, and leaving it to
      be scored to my account; and I had to remonstrate. At last she found out
      Elinor&rsquo;s address, and called upon her. But Elinor was going to London the
      next day; so nothing came of that. This was in December; and early in the
      same month Zizi began to keep her room. She was probably very ill; she
      coughed perpetually. She coughed a good deal when it wasn&rsquo;t necessary, and
      only racked without relieving her poor chest, to say nothing of her
      neighbours&rsquo; nerves. I used to urge her to control her cough, not to cough
      when she could help it; but self-control of any sort was beyond her
      tradition; and she would always cough at the slightest impulse. Once in a
      great while, if she was a little better, and the weather favoured, she
      would put on her rouge and her finery, and go out,&mdash;to &ldquo;<i>pécher à
      la ligne</i>,&rdquo; as she expressed it. Then, on her re-entrance, I would hear
      forlorn attempts at song and laughter, which would inevitably end in long,
      pitiful fits of coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now it is all over; Zizi is dead; and I am as much shocked as if the
      event were inconsequent and unexpected, as if she hadn&rsquo;t been coughing her
      life out steadily these three months past. Ah, well, the difficulty is to
      reconcile one&rsquo;s idea of Zizi with anything not vain and hollow and
      make-believe, with anything natural and sincere; and death is so hideously
      natural, so horribly sincere. For the first time since her birth, I dare
      say, she has done a sincere thing, a real thing,&mdash;she has died!

      THE PRODIGAL FATHER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>is wife had died
      some five and twenty years before, leaving him with an infant son upon his
      hands; and she had made him promise that the boy should be brought up as a
      &ldquo;good American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, poor man, was a desperately bad one. The very word, for instance, as
      he pronounced it, forgot to rhyme with hurricane; and, lest anybody should
      be disposed to look indulgently upon the said offence, I hasten to add
      that he persistently sounded the <i>e</i> in clerk unlike the <i>i</i> in
      dirk. Besides (the homeliness of the detail may be forgiven to its
      significance), he suffered his nose, as an instrument for the
      communication of ideas, to sink into disuse and atrophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he lived in London, and brazenly acknowledged that he liked it better
      than New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      A serious old friend, writing from oversea to remonstrate with him, spoke
      of duty and patriotism, and got this pert reply:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duty, my dear, is the last weakness of great minds; and patriotism, as
      manifested at any rate by such travelling fellow-countrymen of ours as I
      have met on British soil, patriotism corrupts good manners. Of the
      patriots themselves I may say, as of divers birds, orators, operas, and
      women, that they should be seen perhaps, but certainly not heard; and if I
      could not talk, I should not wish to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of principle all this rather shocked his young American wife
      (a Massachusetts girl, who had been bred in the straitest sect of the
      national religion), though in practice she was nearly as shameless as
      himself. Anyhow, she submitted cheerfully to a residence in England, and
      forbore to draw comparisons;&mdash;indeed, if she <i>had</i> drawn them,
      it is not inconceivable that they might have redounded less to the
      disparagement of the elder country than one could have desired.. But then
      she fell ill, and came to die, and was smitten with home-sickness; and
      fond memories of the land of her girlhood begot a sort of dim remorse for
      the small place she had lately let it hold in her affections; and groping
      blindly for something in the nature of atonement, she made her husband
      promise that the boy should be educated as a good American, in an American
      school, and at Harvard College.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, he transported the baby and its nurse to Beacon Street in
      Boston, and deposited them with the dead lady&rsquo;s parents. And as soon as he
      decently could be returned to England; and twenty-five years passed during
      which neither father nor son crossed the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This I am afraid must be confessed, that he was a very, very frivolous
      young person;&mdash;he carried his age as jauntily as his gloves and his
      walking-stick, and would have been genuinely surprised if anybody had
      spoken of him as otherwise than young, though he was fifty-seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a beggarly five hundred a year to his patrimony, he lived at the rate
      of half as many thousand, he who had never earned a sixpence. He had never
      had time, he said; he had been kept too busy doing nothing; he had found
      no leisure for productive industry. What with teas and dinners and dances,
      with visits in country houses and dashes across the channel, with reading
      and conversation, dreaming and sleeping, his days and nights had been too
      full; and so he had had to raise the balance of his expenditures by
      leaving the greater number of his debts unpaid. For pocket-money he
      resorted to what he called reversed post-obits. His son would some day, by
      inheritance from his maternal grandparents, be a rich man; and he would
      surely not refuse, on his father&rsquo;s death, to buy up such stamped paper as
      might bear his father&rsquo;s autograph; and the Jews (a race that always set
      great hopes upon posterity) were happy, with this prospect in view, to
      accommodate him at sixty per cent, per annum.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tall and lean and loosely built, much given to lounging about in
      queer twisted postures, as if double-jointed; whereby a friend was led to
      suggest for his consideration that, when hard-up, he might turn an honest
      penny by enlisting in some itinerant menagerie as India-rubber man. One of
      his eyes met the world unarmoured, with a perfectly vacant stare; the
      other glimmered ambiguously behind a circular shield of glass. He had an
      odd, musical, rather piping voice, in which he drawled forth absurdities
      with such a plaintive, weary, spoiled-child intonation as seemed to hint
      wits tottering and spirits drooping under an almost insupportable burden
      of fatigue and disappointment; whence, for a stranger, it was not at once
      easy to determine if his utterances were funny or only inconsequential.
      When I first made his acquaintance, I remember, I thought for a minute or
      two that I had stumbled upon a tired imbecile,&mdash;then an amusing one,&mdash;then
      an inspired. Some people branded him a snob, others a sort of metaphysical
      rake, but all agreed that he was an entertaining man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had translated the hitherto incomprehensible-seeming motto of his
      house, &ldquo;<i>Estre que fayre</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To be rather than to do.&rdquo; <i>To be</i>:
      to be on all sides a highly developed mortal,&mdash;a scholar, a
      connoisseur, a good talker, an amiable companion, a healthy animal,&mdash;was
      his aim in life, so nearly as it could be said of him that he had an aim.
      And therefore he played golf (it was heartrending, he declared, to see how
      badly), took an intelligent interest in foot-ball, read everything (save
      the hyperbole!) and kept abreast of what was being done in music,
      painting&rsquo;, sculpture, and keramics: in short, went heavily in for all
      forms of unremunerative culture. The theatre he avoided, because he deemed
      acting at its best but a bad reflection of the creative arts, and at its
      worst, as he maintained we got it nowadays, a mere infectious disease of
      the nervous system. Neither would he hunt, shoot, fish, nor eat of any
      flesh, because, he explained, it would be unpleasant to have to consider
      himself a beast of prey. He had a skillful cook, however, and fared
      sumptuously every day on such comestibles as plovers&rsquo; eggs and truffles,
      milk, honey, fruits, and flowers (is not the laborious artichoke a
      flower?), and simple bread and cheese served in half a hundred delectable
      disguises. He dined out, to be sure, six or seven evenings in the week;
      but these were Barmecide feasts for him, and on coming home he could sup.
      When he went to stay in the country he took his cook with him, instead of
      his man; and people bore with his eccentricities because he could say
      diverting things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an epicure, though a vegetarian, a cynic in a benignant, trifling
      way, and a pessimist, though a debonair one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little cheerful pessimism, is a great help here below,&rdquo; he used to
      urge. &ldquo;It takes one over many a rough place. Has it ever struck you to
      reflect how much worse the world might be, if it weren&rsquo;t so bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally, no doubt, his pessimism glowed with a less merry hue: when,
      for instance, he would be short of funds and hard pressed by duns. &ldquo;How
      many noble fellows have fought loyally in the battle to lead a life of
      sweet idleness, and fallen overpowered by the cruel greed of tradesmen! Am
      I to be of their number?&rdquo; he would ask himself sadly at such moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the most indefatigable of human men when engaged in pursuits that
      were entirely profitless, like arranging picnics, going to parties,
      inventing paradoxes, or drinking tea; but when it came to anything
      remotely approaching the sphere of Ought, he was the most indolent, the
      most prone to procrastination. Far, far too indolent, for example, to be a
      possible correspondent,&mdash;unless he were addressing a money-lender or
      a woman,&mdash;whence it resulted that he and his son had written to each
      other but desultorily and briefly, and knew appallingly little of each
      other&rsquo;s state of mind. Three or four years ago the boy, having taken his
      degree at Harvard, had poised for an instant on the brink of a resolution
      to run over and pay his sire a visit; but then he had decided to wait
      about doing that till he should have put in &ldquo;the requisite number of terms
      at the Law School to secure his admission to the Bar,&rdquo; as he expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it appeared, the requisite number had been achieved, for early in
      May, along with the first whiffs of warm air, shimmers of sunshine, and
      rumblings of carriage-wheels in the Park, the elder man received a letter
      that ran like this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, I am sure, be glad to know that I have passed my final
      examinations, and shall shortly have the right to sign LL. B. after my
      name, as well as to practise in the courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to sail for Europe on the 1st of June, by the <i>Teutonic</i>, and
      shall reach London about the 8th. I should like to spend the summer with
      you in England, familiarising myself with British institutions, and in the
      fall go through France and Germany, and down into Italy to pass the
      winter. But of course I should submit my plans to your revision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather and grandmother are keeping very well, and join me in love
      to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate son,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harold Weir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lad seems to have some humour,&rdquo; was the senior Weir&rsquo;s reflection upon
      this epistle. &ldquo;&lsquo;British institutions&rsquo; is rather droll. And if his style
      seems a trifle stiff in the joints, that only results from youth and a
      legal education. I trust to Providence, though, that he mayn&rsquo;t have LL. B.
      engraved upon his card;&mdash;these Americans are capable of anything.
      However I shall be glad to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he began to picture pleasantly to himself the fun that awaited him in
      having a well set-up young man of five and twenty, whose pockets were full
      of money (the maternal grandfather saw to that, thank goodness), to knock
      about with; and he looked forward almost eagerly to the 8th of June. They
      would finish the season in town together, and afterwards do a round of
      country houses, and then make for the Continent: and, taking one
      consideration with another, it would be a tremendous lark. That Harold was
      well set-up he knew from a photograph. His only fear on the score of
      appearance concerned his colouring. That might be trying. However, he
      would hope not; and anyhow, in this world we must take the bitter with the
      sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to Euston (having had due telegraphic warning from Liverpool) to
      welcome the youth on the platform; and he didn&rsquo;t quite know whether to be
      pleased or dismayed when he saw him step from a third-class compartment of
      the train. It was rather smart than otherwise to travel third-class, of
      course; but how could a young American, fresh from democracy, be aware of
      this somewhat recondite canon of aristocratic manners? and might the
      circumstance not argue, therefore, parsimony or a vulgar taste?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no doubt at all, however, about the nature of the emotion that
      Harold&rsquo;s <i>hat</i> aroused in him; for not only was it a &ldquo;topper,&rdquo; but&mdash;as
      if travelling from Liverpool in a topper weren&rsquo;t in itself enough&mdash;it
      had to be a topper of an outlandish, un-English model; and he shuddered to
      speculate for what plebeian provincial thing people might have been
      mistaking this last fruit of his gentle family tree. He hurried the hat&rsquo;s
      wearer out of sight, accordingly, into his brougham, and gave the word to
      drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my baggage?&rdquo; cried the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my man will stop behind and look after that. Give him your receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hat apart, Harold was really a very presentable fellow, tall and
      broad-shouldered, with a clear eye, a healthy brown skin, and a generous
      allowance of well-cropped brown hair; and on the whole he wasn&rsquo;t badly
      dressed: so that his father&rsquo;s heart began to warm to him at once. His
      cheeks and lips were shaven clean, like an actor&rsquo;s or a priest&rsquo;s, whereby
      a certain rigidity was imparted to the lines of his mouth. He held himself
      rather rigidly too, and bolt upright: but as his father had noticed a
      somewhat similar effect in the bearing of a good many unexceptionable
      young Oxford and Cambridge men, he put it down to the fashion of a
      generation, and didn&rsquo;t allow it to distress him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea you kept a carriage,&rdquo; Harold remarked, after an interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should ruin myself in cab-fares, you know,&rdquo; Weir explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume London is a pretty dear city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for that&mdash;shocking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came down on the cars third-class. I want to get near the people while
      I am over here, and see for myself how their status compares to that of
      ours. I want to get a thorough idea of the economic condition of England,
      and see whether what David A. Wells claims for free trade is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; his father responded, dashed a little. But the boy&rsquo;s
      voice was not unpleasant; his accent, considering whence he came, far
      better than could have been expected; and as for his locutions, his choice
      of words, &ldquo;I must cure you of your Americanisms,&rdquo; the hopeful parent
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; the son queried, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, to begin with, don&rsquo;t call me sir. Reserve that for Royalty. I said
      I must try to break you of some of your Americanisms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know. The English say railway for railroad, and box for trunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if it began and ended there!&rdquo; sighed Weir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see why our way isn&rsquo;t as good as theirs. We&rsquo;ve got a
      population of sixty millions to their thirty, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh come, now! Don&rsquo;t confuse the argument by introducing figures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this Harold stared so hard that his father&rsquo;s conscience smote him a
      little, and he asked sympathetically, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you take life rather
      seriously, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; the young man answered with gravity. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the way
      to take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bless you, no. It&rsquo;s too grim a business. The proper spirit to take it
      in is one of unseemly levity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand you&mdash;unless you&rsquo;re joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need limbering up a bit, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; declared his father. &ldquo;But I
      say, we must get you a decent hat. Later in the day I&rsquo;m going to trot you
      off to Mrs. Midsomer-Norton&rsquo;s for tea. Well stop at a hatter&rsquo;s now.&rdquo; And
      he gave the necessary instructions to his coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with the hat I&rsquo;ve got on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not wearing that shape in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will a new one cost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m sure. Five-and twenty shillings, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this one cost me eight dollars in Boston just about three weeks
      ago. Don&rsquo;t you think it would be extravagant to get a new one so soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn the extravagance. We must &lsquo;gae fine&rsquo; whatever we do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time there was a distinct shadow of pain in Harold&rsquo;s stare; and he
      preserved a rueful silence till the brougham drew up at Scott&rsquo;s. He
      followed his father into the shop, however, and submitted stolidly to the
      operation of being fitted. When it came to paying, he pulled a very long
      face indeed, and appeared to have an actual mechanical difficulty in
      squeezing the essential coin from his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you look like a Christian,&rdquo; his father averred, as they got back into
      the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to throw away money, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re close-fisted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to throw away money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a New England prejudice. You&rsquo;ll soon get over it here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. A man ought never to be wasteful&mdash;especially with what
      he hasn&rsquo;t earned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s where I can&rsquo;t agree with you. If a man had <i>earned</i> his
      money he might naturally have some affection for it, and wish to keep it.
      But those who like you and me are entirely vicarious in their sacrifice,
      and spend what other folk have done the grubbing for, can afford to be
      royally free-handed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold made no response, but it was evident that he had a load on his mind
      for the remainder of their drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Mrs. Midsomer-Norton&rsquo;s the young man&rsquo;s bewilderment and melancholy
      seemed to deepen into something not far short of horror, as he formed one
      of a group about his father, and heard that personage singsong out, with
      an air of intense fatigue, his flippant inconsequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little mite of a man present, with a fat white face and a
      great shock of red hair, whom the others called the Bard; and he announced
      that he was writing a poem in which it would be necessary to give a
      general definition of Woman in a single line; and he called upon the
      company to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; wailed Weir, languidly, as he leaned upon the mantelpiece, &ldquo;Woman
      is&mdash;such sweet sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a laugh at this, in which, however, Harold could not join. Then
      the Bard cried, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too abstract;&rdquo; and Weir retorted, drawling, &ldquo;Oh,
      if you must have her defined in terms of matter, Woman is a mass of pins.&rdquo;
       Harold slunk away into a corner, to hide his shame. He felt that his
      father was playing the fool outrageously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bard curled himself up, cross-legged like the bearded Turk, upon the
      hearthrug, and repeated some verses. He called them a &ldquo;villanelle,&rdquo; and
      said they were &ldquo;after the French.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody laughed; but Harold thought the verses silly and uninteresting,
      and full of vain repetitions; and he wondered that grown-up men and women
      could waste their time upon such trivialities.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way home he took his father to task. &ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t mean
      the things you said in that lady&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Did I say anything I hadn&rsquo;t oughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold frowned in wonder at his father&rsquo;s grammar, and replied severely,
      &ldquo;You said a good many things that you couldn&rsquo;t have meant You said a lie
      in time saves nine. You said consistency is the last refuge of a
      scoundrel. You said a lot of things that I can&rsquo;t remember, but which
      seemed to me rather queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re a dreadfully frisky set, you know,&rdquo; Weir explained. Then he
      turned aside for an instant, to get rid of an importunate hansom, that had
      sauntered after them for a hundred yards, the driver raining invitations
      upon them from his &ldquo;dicky.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> be driven. I&rsquo;ll be
      led, but I won&rsquo;t be driven,&rdquo; he said, resolutely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get accustomed
      to us, though,&rdquo; he continued, addressing his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say the people of your set are always like that? Why,
      there wasn&rsquo;t a single person there that you could converse with seriously
      about anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; his father protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the son&rsquo;s commentary was not to be diverted. &ldquo;I asked that gentleman
      they called Major what he thought the effect of smokeless powder would be
      upon future warfare; and he looked perfectly paralysed, and said he didn&rsquo;t
      know, he was sure. And that member of Parliament from Sheffingham, I asked
      him what the population of Sheffingham was, and <i>he</i> didn&rsquo;t know. And
      that lady,&mdash;Lady Angela something,&mdash;-I asked her how she liked
      &lsquo;Robert Elsmere,&rsquo; and she said she didn&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid our friends thought you had rather a morbid appetite for
      information, Harold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must say, I thought they were very superficial. All froth and
      glitter. Nothing solid or genuine about them. And that poem that little
      red-haired man recited! Now in American houses of that sort you&rsquo;d hear
      serious conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your taste is austere. But you must be charitable, you must make
      allowances. Besides, some of us aren&rsquo;t so superficial as you&rsquo;d think. All
      that glitters isn&rsquo;t pinchbeck. Major Northbrook, for example, is the best
      polo player in England. And Lady Angela Folbourne is very nearly the most
      disreputable woman. A reg&rsquo;lar bad un, you know, and makes no bones of it,
      either. Perfectly, frankly, cynically wicked. Yet somehow or other she
      contrives to keep her place in society, and goes to Court. You see, she
      must have solid qualities, real abilities, somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean she&rsquo;s wicked,&mdash;in what sense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say! You mustn&rsquo;t expect me to dot my i&rsquo;s and cross my t&rsquo;s like
      that. A sort of <i>société en commandite</i>, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, but then, gracious heavens! she&rsquo;s no better than a&mdash;than a
      professional&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse, worse, my clear. She&rsquo;s an amateur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you should know such a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bless you, she&rsquo;s a Vestal Virgin to ladies I could introduce you to
      across the Channel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How horrible!&rdquo; cried the young American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re a Nonconformist,&rdquo; his father
      pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Episcopalian,&rdquo; the son answered. He relapsed into his stare; and
      then at dinner it turned out that he was a teetotaller and didn&rsquo;t use
      tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his diary, before he went to bed. Harold made this entry:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London cab-fares are sixpence a mile, with a minimum of a shilling. There
      are upwards of 10,000 cabs in London. The city is better paved than
      Boston, but not so clean. Many of the wards preserve their original
      parochial systems of government. The people aren&rsquo;t so go-ahead as ours,
      and the whole place lacks modernity. The tone of English society seems to
      be very low. To-morrow I shall visit Westminster Abbey, St. Paul&rsquo;s
      Cathedral, Hyde Park, the British Museum, and the Victoria Embankment.
      Qy.: what was the cost of the construction of the latter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That will give a notion of the dance he led his father on the following
      day. Harold stared at most of the &ldquo;sights,&rdquo; as he called them, in solemn
      silence. Of Westminster, however, he remarked that it was in a bad state
      of repair. &ldquo;The English people don&rsquo;t seem to have much enterprise about
      them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now if this were in America&mdash;&rdquo; But his father did
      not catch the conclusion. St. Paul&rsquo;s struck him as surprisingly dirty.
      &ldquo;You should see the new Auditorium in Chicago,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I was out
      there last year. That&rsquo;s what I call fine architecture.&rdquo; And then, as they
      drove along the Embankment, he propounded his query anent its cost; and
      his father cried, &ldquo;If you ask me questions like that. I shall faint.&rdquo;
       Harold&rsquo;s diary that night received this pathetic confidence:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole London doesn&rsquo;t come up to any of the large American cities.
      As for my father, I hoped yesterday that he was only putting it on for a
      joke, but I&rsquo;m afraid now that he really is very light-minded. He wears an
      eyeglass and speaks with a strong English accent. Expenses this day. And
      so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder Weir, at the same time, was likewise engaged in literary
      composition:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Mrs. Winchfield.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in great distress about my son. You don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve got one? Oh,
      but I give you my word! He&rsquo;s just reached me from America, where I left
      him as a hostage a quarter of a century ago. And he&rsquo;s full of the most
      awful heathenish ideas. I never met so serious a person. He doesn&rsquo;t drink,
      he doesn&rsquo;t smoke; he thinks I&rsquo;m undignified, if you can imagine that; and
      he objects to my calling him Hal, though his name is Harold. I feel like a
      frisky little boy beside him,&mdash;like the child that is father to the
      man. Then his thirst for knowledge is positively disgraceful. He has
      nearly killed me to-day, <i>doing</i> London, guide-book in hand, and
      asking <i>such</i> embarrassing questions. Can you tell me, please, how
      long the Houses of Parliament were a-building?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how many dollars there are in the vaults of the Bank of England? And
      what the salary of a policeman is? And who is &lsquo;about the biggest lawyer
      over here?&rsquo; The way he dragged me up and down the town was most unfilial.
      We&rsquo;ve been everywhere, I think, except to my club. But he&rsquo;s a very
      good-looking fellow, and I don&rsquo;t doubt he&rsquo;s got the right sort of stuff
      dormant in him somewhere, only it wants bringing out. I can&rsquo;t help feeling
      that what he needs is the influence of a fine, sensitive, irresponsible
      woman, someone altogether wayward and ribald, to lighten and loosen him,
      and impart a little froth and elasticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was entirely broken-hearted when I heard that you were going to stop at
      Sere all summer; but even for adversity there are sweet uses; and I wish
      you would ask my boy down to stay with you. I&rsquo;m sure you can do him good,
      unless too many months of country air have made a sober woman of you. Do
      try to Christianise him, and a father&rsquo;s heart will reward you with its
      blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours always,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A. Weir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Harold went down to Sere; and a fortnight later Mrs. Winchfield wrote
      as follows to his parent:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Weir,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s hopeless. I&rsquo;ve done my utmost, and I&rsquo;ve failed
      grotesquely. Yesterday I chanced to say, in your young one&rsquo;s presence, to
      Colonel Buttington, who&rsquo;s staying here, that if my husband were only away,
      I should so enjoy a desperate flirtation with him. Harold, dear boy,
      looked scandalised, and by and by, catching me alone, he asked (in the
      words of Father William&rsquo;s interlocutor) whether I thought at my age it was
      right? He is like the Frenchman who took his wife to the play, and chid
      her when she laughed, saying, &lsquo;<i>Nous ne sommes pas ici pour nous amuser</i>,&rsquo;
      I am sending him back by the morning train to morrow. Keep him with you,
      and try to cultivate a few domestic virtues. <i>A vous</i>,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret Winchfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold arrived, looking very grave. But his father looked graver still,
      and he invited the young man into the library, and gave him a piece of his
      mind. It produced no sensible effect. At last, &ldquo;Well, I hope at least you
      tipped the servants liberally?&rdquo; the poor man questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I don&rsquo;t believe in tipping servants. What are they paid their
      wages for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite irreclaimable,&rdquo; the father cried. &ldquo;May I ask how long you
      mean to remain in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall need about two months to do it thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father left the room, and gave orders to his man to pack for a long
      journey.

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t had been the old
      familiar story, in its most hackneyed version.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was nineteen; he was three or four and twenty, with an income just
      sufficient to keep him in bread and cheese, and for prospects and position
      those of an art-student in a land of money-grubbers. And her parents, who
      were wise in their generation, wouldn&rsquo;t hear of a betrothal; whilst the
      young people, who were foolish in theirs, hadn&rsquo;t the courage of their
      folly. And so&mdash;the usual thing happened. They vowed eternal constancy&mdash;&ldquo;If
      it can&rsquo;t be you, it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;. be anyone!&rdquo;&mdash;and said good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his native hemisphere, to acquire technique in the schools of
      Paris; and she, after an interval of a year or two, married another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, though in its letter their tale was commonplace enough, the spirit of
      it, on his side at least, was a little rare. I suppose that most young
      lovers love with a good deal of immediate energy; but his love proved to
      be of a fibre that could resist the tooth of time. At any rate, years went
      their way, and he never quite got over it; he was true to that
      conventional old vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This resulted in part, no doubt, from the secluded, the concentrated,
      manner of his life, passed aloof from actuality, in a studio <i>au
      cinquième</i>, alone with his colour-tubes and his ideals; but I think it
      was due in part also to his temperament. He was the sort of man of whom
      those who know him will exclaim, when his name comes up, &ldquo;Ah yes&mdash;the
      dear fellow!&rdquo; Everybody liked him, and all laughed at him more or less. He
      was extremely simple-minded and trustful, very quiet, very modest, very
      gentle and sympathetic; by no means without wit, nor altogether without
      humour, yet in the main disposed to take things a trifle too seriously in
      a world where levity tempered by suspicion is the only safe substitute for
      a wholesome, whole-souled cynicism. Though an uncompromising realist in
      his theories, I suspect that down at bottom he was inclined to be
      romantic, if not even sentimental. His friends would generally change the
      subject when he came into the room, because to the ordinary flavour of
      men&rsquo;s talk he showed a womanish repugnance. In the beginning, on this
      account, they had of course voted him a prig; but they had ended by
      regarding it as a bothersome little eccentricity, that must be borne with
      in view of his many authentic virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest, he had a sweet voice, a good figure and carriage, a
      clean-cut Saxon face, and a pleasing, graceful talent, which, in the
      course of time, fostered by industry, had brought him an honourable
      mention, several medals, then the red ribbon, and at last the red rosette.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was what they call a successful man; and he had succeeded in a career
      where success carries a certain measure of celebrity: yet it was a habit
      of his mind to think of himself as a failure. This was partly because he
      had too just a realising sense of the nature of art, to fancy that success
      in art&mdash;success in giving material form to the visions of the
      imagination&mdash;is ever possible; an artist might be defined as one
      whose mission it is to fail. At all events, neither medals nor decorations
      could blind him to the circumstance that there was a terrible gulf between
      what he had intended and what he had accomplished, between the great
      pictures of his dreams and the canvasses that bore his signature. But in
      thinking of himself as a failure, I am sure he was chiefly influenced by
      the recollection that he had not been able to marry that dark-eyed young
      American girl twenty years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first it had changed life to a sort of waking nightmare for him. He had
      come abroad with a heart that felt as if it had been crushed between the
      upper and the nether millstones. His ambition was dead, and his interest
      in the world. He could not work, because he could see no colour in the
      sky, and nothing but futility in art; and he could not play,&mdash;he
      could not throw himself into the dissipations of the Quarter, and so
      benumb his hurt a little with immediate physical excitements,&mdash;because
      pleasure in all its forms had lost its savour. Then a kindly Providence
      interposed, and ordained that he should drink a glass of infected water,
      or breathe a mouthful of poisoned air, and fall ill of typhoid fever, and
      forget; and when he was convalescent, and remembered again, he remembered
      this: that she had sworn on her soul to be constant to him. Whereupon he
      said, &ldquo;I will work like twenty Trojans, and annihilate time, and earn
      money, and go home with an assured position; and then her parents can have
      no further pretext for withholding their consent.&rdquo; In this resolution he
      found great comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been working like twenty Trojans for about a twelvemonth, when he
      got the news of her marriage to the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced to reach him (in a letter from a friend, saying it would be
      celebrated in a fortnight) on the very day of its occurrence; and that, by
      a pleasant coincidence, was his birthday. In a fit of cynical despair he
      asked a lot of his schoolfellows, and a few, ladies of the neighbourhood,
      to dine with him; and they feasted and made merry till well into the
      following morning, when, for the first and almost the only time in his
      life, he had to be helped home, drunk. His drunkenness, though, was
      perhaps not altogether to be regretted. It kept him from thinking; and for
      that particular night it was conceivably better, on the whole, that he
      should not think.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mood of cynical recklessness lasted for a month or two. He celebrated
      the wedding&mdash;<i>faisait la noce</i>, as the local idiom runs&mdash;in
      a double sense, and with feverish diligence. For a moment it seemed a
      toss-up what would become of him: whether he would sink into the condition
      of a chronic <i>noceur</i>, or return to the former decent tenor of his
      way. It happened, however, that he had no appetite for alcohol, and that
      bad music, bad air, evil communications, gaslight, and late hours failed
      to afford him any permanent satisfaction: whilst, as for other women,&mdash;who
      that has savoured nectar can care for milk and water?&mdash;who that has
      lost a rose can be consoled with an artificial flower? This was how he put
      it to himself All the women he knew on the right bank of the Seine were,
      to his taste, mortally insipid; those whom he knew on the left were
      stuffed with sawdust.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the consequence was that one morning he went to work again; and in
      spite of the dull pain in his heart, he worked steadily, doggedly, from
      day to day, from year to year, scarcely noting the progress of time, in
      the absorbed and methodical nature of his life, till presently he had
      turned forty, and was what they call a successful man. Of course the dull
      pain in his heart had softened gradually into something that was not
      entirely painful; into something whose sadness was mixed with sweetness,
      like plaintive music; but her image remained enshrined as an idol in his
      memory, and I doubt if ever a day passed without his spending some portion
      thereof in worship before it. He never walked abroad, either, through the
      Paris streets, without thinking, &ldquo;What if I should meet her!&rdquo; (It would be
      almost inevitable that she should some time come to Paris.) And at this
      prospect his heart would leap and his pulses quicken like a boy&rsquo;s. For art
      and love between them had kept him young; it had indeed never struck him
      to count his lustres, or to reflect that in point of them he was
      middle-aged. Besides, he lived in a country whose amiable custom it is to
      call every man a lad until he marries. Regularly once a year, in the
      autumn, he had sent a picture to be exhibited at New York, in the hope
      that she might see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave his brushes to be washed rather earlier than usual this afternoon,
      and went for a stroll in the garden of the Luxembourg. The air was
      languorous with the warmth and the scent of spring; in the sunshine the
      marble queens, smiling their still, stony smile, gleamed with a thousand
      tints of rose and amethyst, as if they had been carved of some iridescent
      substance, like mother-of-pearl. The face of the old palace glowed with
      mellow fire; the sleek, dark-green foliage of the chestnut-trees was
      tipped here and there with pallid gold; and in the deep shade of the <i>allées</i>
      underneath innumerable children romped vociferously, and innumerable pairs
      of lovers sentimentalised in silence. Of course they were only mock
      lovers, students and their <i>étudiantes</i>; but one could forget that
      for the moment, and all else that is ugly, in the circumambient charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a penny chair by and by, and sat down at the edge of the terrace,
      and watched the dance of light and shadow on the waters of the fountain,
      and thanked Heaven for the keen, untranslatable delight he was able to
      feel in the beauty of the world. He drank it in with every sense, as if it
      were an ethereal form of wine; but no wine was so delicious, no wine could
      have penetrated and thrilled and stimulated him as it did. It was a part
      of his philosophy,&mdash;I might almost say an article of his religion,&mdash;to
      count his faculty for deriving exquisite pleasure from every phase of the
      beautiful as in some sort a compensation for many of the good things of
      life that he had missed; and yet, in one way at least, so far from serving
      as a compensation, it only added to his loss. In the presence of whatever
      was beautiful, under the spell of it, he always longed with intensified
      pain for her. And now presently, as he had done in like circumstances
      countless times before, he sighed for her, inwardly: &ldquo;Ah, if she were
      here! If we could enjoy it all together!&rdquo;&mdash;I dare say, poor man, it
      was a little ridiculous at his age; but he did not see the humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pictured her to himself, her slender figure, her white, eager face,
      with its penumbra of brown hair, soft as smoke, and its dark eyes, deep
      and luminous, as if pale fires were burning infinitely far within them. He
      heard her voice, low and melodious, and her crisp, girlish laughter. And
      she smiled upon him, a faint, sad smile, that was full of tenderness and
      yearning and regret. He took her hands, her warm little rosy hands, and
      marvelled over them, as he caressed them. They were like images in
      miniature of herself, so sensitive, so fragile, so helpless-seeming, yet
      possessed of such amazing talents: for when he watched them leaping above
      the ivory keys of her piano, invariably striking the right note with the
      right degree of stress and the right interval of time (although to an
      uninitiated witness their movement must have appeared quite wanton), he
      wondered at them as a pair of witches.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had not reckoned his own years, or marked their action upon himself,
      it is certain that he had treated her with no less forbearance. She came
      back to him always the same; always the girl of nineteen whom he had left
      behind him nearly a quarter of a century ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, if she were only with him now, here in the quaint old garden of the
      Luxembourg! How complete and unutterable his joy would be! He would lead
      her beside the great basin of the fountain, where the goldfishes flashed
      like flames; and they would stop before the statues of the queens, and
      tell over for each other the romantic histories of those dead royal
      ladies; and how much warmer the sunshine would be, how much greener the
      earth, how much sweeter the fragrance of the air! By and by they would
      enter the museum, where he would show her that picture of his which the
      State had honoured him by buying, and which, he had received a whispered
      promise, should some day find its way into the Louvre. Afterwards they
      would saunter down the Boulevard, past the Castle of Cluny, across the
      bridge, into the open space before Notre Dame. And all the while they
      would talk, talk, talk, making up for the time that they had lost; and
      their wounds would be healed, and their hearts would be at rest. It was
      strange, he thought, that she had never come abroad. All Americans come
      sooner or later, and one is perpetually running across those one happens
      to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never run across her, however, though he had never left off
      expecting to do so. This very afternoon, for instance, how entirely
      natural it would seem to meet her. The annual irruption of his
      country-people had begun; thousands of them were in Paris at this moment:
      why not she among them? And she would certainly not come to Paris without
      visiting the Luxembourg; and to-day was a perfect day for such a visit;
      and&mdash;if he should look up now....
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up, holding his breath for a second, almost thinking to see her
      advancing towards him. Surely enough, somebody <i>was</i> advancing
      towards him, standing before him there in the path, making signals to him.
      But, as the mists of his day-dream cleared away, he perceived that it was
      only the old woman come to take his penny for the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went home, a very lonely man in a very empty world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It felt cold to him now; the sky had grown gray. He had a fire kindled in
      his drawing-room, and sat dejectedly before it through the twilight. After
      a while his servant brought in the lamps, at the same time handing him a
      parcel that had come from his bookseller&rsquo;s. The parcel was wrapped in an
      old copy of the Paris edition of the <i>New York Herald</i>; and he spread
      it out, and glanced at it listlessly. It always filled him with a vague
      sort of melancholy to look at an old newspaper; on the day of its
      appearance the life that it recorded, the joys and pains, had seemed of so
      great importance, such instant interest; and now they mattered as little,
      they were as much a part of ancient history, as the lives and the joys and
      the sorrows of the Cæsars. His eye fell presently upon a column headed <i>Obituary</i>;
      and there he read of the death of Samuel Merrow. He turned the paper up
      hurriedly to discover its date; November of last year; quite six months
      ago. Samuel Merrow had died at New York, six months ago; and Samuel Merrow
      was her husband.

      II
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here were not many
      passengers on the steamer; at this season the current of travel ran in the
      opposite direction. There was a puffy little white-haired, important man,
      who accosted him on the deck, the second day out, and asked whether it was
      his first visit abroad that he was returning from. He reflected for a
      moment, and answered yes; for though he had lived abroad half a lifetime,
      he had crossed the ocean only once before. He was too shy to enter upon an
      explanation, so he answered yes. Then the puffy man boasted of the immense
      numbers of voyages <i>he</i> had made. &ldquo;Oh, I know Europe!&rdquo; he declaimed,
      and told how his business&mdash;he described himself as &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; for a firm
      of printing-ink importers&mdash;took him to that continent two or three
      times a year. He had an inquiring mind, and a great facility for
      questioning people. &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Aigrefield,&rdquo; he said (he had learned
      our friend&rsquo;s name from the passenger-list) &ldquo;but what does that red button
      in your buttonhole mean? Some society you belong to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aigrefield, concealing what he suffered, again sought refuge in an
      ambiguous yes; but he slunk away to his cabin, and put the &ldquo;red button&rdquo; in
      his box: it was absurd to wear the insignia of a French order outside of
      France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of course, the ship&rsquo;s company was completed by a highly intelligent
      lady in eyeglasses, who lay in a deck-chair all day, and read Mr. Pater&rsquo;s
      <i>Mariys</i> (the volume lasted her throughout the voyage); a statistical
      clergyman, returning from his vacation, a mine of practical
      misinformation; a couple of Frenchmen, travelling no one could guess why,
      since they seemed quite cast-down and in despair about it; a half-dozen
      Hebrews, travelling one couldn&rsquo;t help knowing wherefore, since they
      discussed &ldquo;voollens&rdquo; and prices and shipments at the tops of their
      cheerful voices; and the inevitable young Western girl, travelling alone.
      For the first time in twenty years, almost, he had descended from the
      cloud he lived in, and was rubbing against the actualities of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highly intelligent lady &ldquo;knew who he was,&rdquo; as she told him sweetly,
      and would speak of nothing but art, in her highly intelligent way. If he
      had had more humour, her perfervid enthusiasms, couched in an extremely
      rudimental studio-slang (she talked a vast deal of values and keys, of
      atmosphere and light, of things being badly modelled or a little &ldquo;out&rdquo;)&mdash;if
      he had had more humour, all this might have amused him; but he was, as we
      have said, somewhat too literally inclined; and the cant of it jarred upon
      him, and made him sick at heart. Her formula for opening up a topic, &ldquo;Now,
      Mr. Aigrefield, tell me, what do you think of...&rdquo; became an obsession,
      that would descend upon him in the dead of night, making him dread the
      morrow. All these people, he remarked, Mr. Aigrefielded him unpityingly.
      He wished the English language had, for the use of his compatriots (in
      England they seem to get on well enough without forever naming names) a
      mode of address similar to the French <i>monsieur</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the solitary young Western girl he liked. She had made her first
      appeal to his eye, through her form and colour; but when he came to know
      her a little he liked her for her spirit. She was tall, with a strong,
      supple figure, a face picturesque in the discreet irregularity of its
      features, a pair of limpid gray eyes, a fresh complexion, and an
      overhanging ornament of warm brown hair. She was much given to smiling,
      also,&mdash;a smile that played in lovely curves about lips, if anything,
      a thought too full, a semitone too scarlet,&mdash;whence he inferred that
      she had an amiable disposition, a light heart, and an easy conscience.
      Hearing her speak, he observed that her voice was of a depth, smoothness,
      and rotundity, that atoned in great measure for the occidental quality of
      her accent. At all events, he was drawn to her: they walked the deck a
      good deal together, and often had their chairs placed side by side. He
      philosophised her attraction for him by saying, &ldquo;She is a force of nature,
      she is fresh and simple.&rdquo; The &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; for the firm of printing-ink
      importers had struck him as fresh, indeed, but not as simple; the lady who
      read Mr. Pater, as simple but not fresh; the Hebrew gentlemen, even the
      unhappy Frenchmen, if you will, as natural forces: but the Western girl
      combined these several advantages in her single person, and so she became
      his favourite amongst his shipmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her name was Lillian Goddard; she lived in Minneapolis, where, as she
      informed him, her father was a judge. She had been abroad nearly a year,
      had passed the winter in Rome, could speak a little Italian, a little
      French, and an immense deal of American. I have described her as young,
      and I hope it will not be considered an anachronism when I add that her
      age was twenty-six.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was tremendously patriotic, and appeared shocked and grieved when she
      learned that he had remained continuously absent from his country for a
      score of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the more I saw of Europe, the more I loved dear old America,&rdquo; she
      declared, in her deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just as homesick as she could be, she said, and couldn&rsquo;t get back
      to Minneapolis fast enough. Did he know the West?&mdash;and again she
      appeared shocked at discovering the profundities of his ignorance
      concerning it. Oh, he must certainly see the West. No American could begin
      to appreciate his country till he had seen the West. The people out there
      were so <i>alive</i>, so go-ahead; and they took such an interest in all
      forms of culture too, in literature, music, painting, the drama. &ldquo;Why,
      look at the big magazines,&mdash;they depend for their circulation on the
      West.&rdquo; And then, the <i>homes</i> of the West! &ldquo;Oh, if I lived in Europe,
      I should lose my faith in human nature. Western people are so warmhearted.
      I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re awfully unpatriotic, Mr. Aigrefield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reminded her that patriotism was the last refuge of a scoundrel; and
      anyhow, he pleaded, it was too much to expect of one small man that he
      should be patriotic for a continent. But she shook her head at his
      perversity, and guessed he&rsquo;d be proud enough of his Continent if he had
      seen it, and insisted that he must come to Minneapolis, and look round.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked her amazingly. As their voyage grew older, he found himself
      taking a greater and greater pleasure in her propinquity; looking forward
      with something akin to eagerness to meeting her on deck, as he
      accomplished his morning toilet; and recalling fondly their commerce of
      the day, as he turned in at night. Besides, the charm of her strong,
      irregular beauty grew upon him, and he said to her, smiling, &ldquo;When I come
      to Minneapolis you must let me try a portrait of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then you are really coming?&rdquo; she demanded, striving to fix him in a
      pious resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed vaguely, and she protested, &ldquo;Oh, shame, Mr. Aigrefield, now you
      are wriggling out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt that she was sweet and sound and honest: direct, vigorous,
      bracing: he wondered if indeed she might not owe these qualities, in some
      part, to her native Western soil; and he admitted that the West was
      beginning to take a place in his affections. Heretofore, it had been a
      mere geographical abstraction for him, and one he would have shrunk from
      realising through experience. He imagined the colouring would be hard, the
      action violent, the atmosphere raw and rough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whether I really come or not, I am sure I should really like to,&rdquo;
       he said now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s such an innocent desire,&rdquo; she cried, with a touch of mockery. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think it would be selfish to indulge it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I do come, you will sit for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d do anything in such a cause&mdash;to make a patriot of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the outset of his journey, his impatience to reach the end of it was so
      great, the progress of the steamer had seemed exasperatingly slow. But as
      they began to near New York, a vague dread of what might await him there,
      a vague recoil from the potential and the unknown, made him almost wish
      that the throbbing of the engines were not so rapid. A cloud of dismal
      possibilities haunted his imagination, filling it with a strange chill and
      ache. He had never paused before to think of the many things that had had
      time to happen in twenty years; and now they assailed his mind in a mass,
      and appalled it. Even the preliminary business of discovering her
      whereabouts, for instance, might prove difficult enough; and then&mdash;&mdash;-?
      In matters of this sort, at any rate, it is the next step which costs. In
      twenty years what ties and affections she might have formed, that would
      make him a necessary stranger to her life, and leave no room for him in
      her heart. He was jealous of a supposititious lover (he had lived in
      France too long to remember that in America lovers are not the fashion),
      of supposititious children, supposititious interests and occupations:
      jealous and afraid. And of course it was always to be reckoned with as in
      the bounds of the conceivable, that she might be disconsolate for the loss
      of Mr. Merrow: though this, for some reason, seemed the least likely of
      the contingencies he had to face. Mr. Merrow, he knew, had been a
      cotton-broker; he had always fancied him as a big, rather florid person,
      with a husky voice: capable perhaps of inspiring a mild fondness, but not
      of a character to take hold upon the deeper emotional strands of Pauline&rsquo;s
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      His nervousness increased inordinately after the pilot came aboard. He
      marched rapidly backwards and forwards on the deck, scarcely conscious of
      what he was saying to Miss Goddard, who kept pace with him. She laughed
      presently&mdash;her deep contralto laughter; and then he inquired very
      seriously whether he had said anything absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you <i>know</i> what you said?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t just remember. I was thinking of something else,&rdquo; he
      confessed, knitting his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not very complimentary to me, now, is it? Still, if you can
      say such things without knowing it, I suppose I must forgive you. I asked
      you what you thought was the best short definition of life, and you said a
      chance to make mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never could have said anything so good if I had had my wits about me,&rdquo;
       he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Countless old memories and associations were surging up within him now;
      and as he leaned over the rail and gazed into the murky waters of the New
      York Bay, the European chapters of his life became a mere parenthesis, and
      the text joined itself to the word at which it had been interrupted when
      he was four and twenty. Sorry patriot though he might be, he was still
      made of flesh and blood; and he could not approach the land of his
      childhood, his youth, his love and loss, without some stirrings of the
      heartstrings besides those that were evoked by the prospect of meeting
      her. His other old companions would no doubt be dead or scattered; or they
      would have forgotten him as he, indeed, till yesterday had forgotten them.
      Anyhow, he would not attempt to look them up. He knew that he should feel
      an alien among his own people; he would not heighten the dreariness of
      that situation by ferreting out former intimates to find himself
      unrecognized, or by inquiring about them to be told that they were dead.
      He hadn&rsquo;t very clearly formulated his positive intentions, but they
      probably lay in his sub-consciousness, brief and to the point, if somewhat
      short-sighted and unpractical: he would do his wooing as speedily as might
      be, and bear his bride triumphantly over-sea, to his home in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bade Miss Goddard good-bye on the dock, whilst his trunks were being
      rifled by the Custom House inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mind, you are to come to Minneapolis,&rdquo; she insisted, as her hand lay
      in his, returning its pressure; and he could perceive a shade of
      earnestness behind the smile that lighted up her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye,&rdquo; he answered, fervently, moved all at once by a
      feeling he would have had some difficulty in naming. &ldquo;I may surprise you
      by turning up there one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then her hand was withdrawn, and she disappeared in a hackney-carriage. He
      went back to the task of getting his luggage examined, with a sense of
      having been abandoned by his last friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fortitude it must require to live here,&rdquo; was the reflection that
      made him shake his head, as he drove over the rough paving-stones, through
      the dirty, ignoble streets, to his hotel. It struck him as more depressing
      still, when he emerged from the sordid tangle of the lower town into the
      smug rectangularity of the upper. He was sure that Pauline would be glad
      enough to exchange it all for the airy perspectives, the cleanliness, the
      gay colours, the variety of Paris. Of course he would have to give up his
      bachelor chambers overlooking the Luxembourg. He would rent, or buy, or
      even build, a proper house for her, in the quarter of the Etoile, or near
      the Parc Monceau.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned over the pages of the Directory that the hotel-clerk
      condescendingly pointed out to him, and found that Mr. Morrow&rsquo;s address
      had been twenty-something in a street that had no name, but only a number
      and a point of the compass to serve for one; and that seemed to him in
      thorough keeping with the unimaginative, business-like character of the
      deceased cotton-broker. Pauline, in her widowhood, would very likely have
      moved away. It was too late to make a call to-day, being nearly
      dinner-time (he had forgotten that in New York it is not forbidden to call
      after dinner), but he would write her a little note, informing her of his
      arrival, and proposing to come to-morrow in the forenoon. On the corner of
      the envelope he would put &ldquo;Please forward,&rdquo; to anticipate the event of her
      having moved. Then he could leave it to destiny and the post-office
      authorities to do the rest.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Fifth Avenue
      reached out in an endless straight line before him, the prose of its
      architecture being obscured by the gathering twilight, and punctuated
      monotonously by the street-lamps. Attached to one of these he found a
      letter-box presently, and into it he dropped the note that he had written.
      &ldquo;Does Mrs. Merrow&mdash;Pauline Lake that was&mdash;remember Henry
      Aigrefield? And if so, may he call upon her to-morrow at eleven?&rdquo; That was
      how, after destroying a dozen sheets of paper, he had at last contrived to
      phrase his message.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly up the long Avenue, cut at right angles, and at fixed
      intervals of two hundred feet, by streets that looked enough like one
      another to suggest the notion that they had all been cast in the same
      dreary mould, and furnished to the municipality ready-made; past the
      innumerable coffee-coloured houses, with their damnable iteration of rigid
      little doorsteps; and he wondered at the purblind complacency of a people
      who could honestly regard this as among the finest thoroughfares of the
      world. The region he was traversing reminded him of certain melancholy
      acres in the south of London, where the city-clerk has his humble,
      cheerless home: it was such a neighbourhood grown rich and pretentious,
      but in nowise mellowed or beautified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would <i>she</i> live in one of these insignificant boxes of brown stone?
      &ldquo;26, E. 51,&rdquo; the address he had read in the Directory, sounded
      sufficiently unpromising. It had been Mr. Merrow&rsquo;s house, and Mr. Morrow
      had been a practical New Yorker. But the interior? He pictured the
      interior as entirely lovely and delightful, for, in the nature of things,
      the interior would owe its character to Mr. Merrow&rsquo;s wife. A good
      distemper on the walls, something light in key, yet warm&mdash;brick-dust,
      or a pearly, rosy gray; simple, graceful chairs and tables; a few good
      pictures, numberless good books in good bindings: over all the soft glow
      of candlelight; and in the midst of all, giving unity and meaning to it
      all, a lady, a tall slender lady, in a black gown, with a pale serious
      face, dark eyes full of sleeping fire, and above her white brow a rich
      shadow of brown hair. She was reading, her head bent a little, her feet
      resting on a small tabouret of some dull red stuff that lent depth to the
      bottom of the picture, while the candlelight playing upon her hair, upon
      her cheek and throat, upon the ivory page of her book and the hand that
      held it, made the upper and middle portions radiant. After twenty years
      how little changed she was! Her face had lost nothing of its girlish
      delicacy, its maiden innocence, it had only gained a quality of firmness,
      of seriousness and strength. He found a woman where he had left a child,
      but the woman was only the child ripened and ennobled. As the door opened
      to admit him, she raised her eyes, puzzled for a moment, not seeing who he
      was; but then, suddenly, she stood up and moved towards him, calling his
      name, very low, very low, so that it fell upon his ears like a note of
      music. And his heart pounded suffocatingly, and he trembled deliciously in
      all his limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, he began to ask himself now, why, after all, should he put off till
      to-morrow the realisation of this great joy? If it was unconventional to
      pay a call in the evening, she, who had never been a stickler for the
      conventionalities, would forgive it to the ardour and the impatience of
      his passion, He had waited for her twenty years; that was long enough,
      without adding to it another interminable period of twelve hours. Anyhow,
      there could be no harm in his ringing the bell of No. 26, E. 51, and
      inquiring whether she still lived there, and, if not, whither she had
      gone. Thereby a further saving of precious hours might be effected; and&mdash;and
      he would do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house, indeed, appeared in no particular different to the multitude
      that he had left behind him; but he could have embraced the Irish
      maid-servant who opened the door for him, because to both of his questions
      she answered yes. Yes, Mrs. Merrow lived here; and yes, she was at home.
      Would he walk into the parlour, please, and what name should she say? Lest
      the name should get perverted in its transmission, he equipped her with
      his card. Then he sat down in the &ldquo;parlour&rdquo; to await his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bare room, and, by the glare of the gas that lighted it, he saw
      that the influence of Mr. Merrow had penetrated at least thus far beyond
      his threshold. The floor was covered by a carpet in the flowery taste of
      1860. The chairs were upholstered in thick, hot-hued plush, with a
      geometric pattern embossed upon it. A vast procession of little vases and
      things in porcelain, multiplied by the mantel-mirror and the pier-glass,
      shed an added forlornness on the spaces they were meant to decorate, but
      only cluttered up, Pauline&rsquo;s domain, he concluded, would be above stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door swung open after a few minutes, and he rose, with a sudden
      heart-leap, to greet her. But no&mdash;it was only a fat,
      uninteresting-looking woman (a visitor, a sister-in-law, he reasoned
      swiftly) come to make Pauline&rsquo;s excuses, probably, if she kept him
      waiting. He noticed that the fat lady was in mourning; and that confirmed
      his guess that she would prove to be a relative of the late Mr. Merrow.
      She wore her hair in a series of stiff ringlets (&ldquo;bandelettes&rdquo; I believe
      they are technically called) over a high, sloping forehead; the hair was
      thin and stringy, so that, he told himself, her brother had no doubt been
      bald. Two untransparent eyes gazed placidly out of the white expanses of
      her face; and he thought, as he took her in, that she might serve as an
      incarnation of all the dulness and platitude that he had felt in the air
      about him from the hour of his landing in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he stood there, silent, making a sort of interrogative bow, and
      waiting for her to state her business.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seemed to be studying him with some curiosity, of a mild,
      phlegmatic kind, from which he argued that perhaps she was not wholly
      unenlightened about his former relation to her brother&rsquo;s widow. But now he
      experienced a distinct spasm of horror, as she threw her head to one side,
      and, opening her lips, remarked lymphatically, in a resigned, unresonant
      voice, &ldquo;Well, I declare! Is that you, Harry Aigrefield? Why, you&rsquo;re as
      gray as a rat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank back into his chair, overwhelmed by the abrupt disenchantment; and
      he understood that it was reciprocal.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      He sat, inert, amid the pieces of his broken idol, for perhaps a half
      hour, and chatted with Mrs. Merrow of various things. She asked him if he
      was still as crazy about painting pictures as he used to be: to which he
      answered, with a hollow laugh, that he feared he was. Well, she said,
      playfully, she presumed there always had to be some harum-scarum people in
      the world; and added that &ldquo;Sam&rdquo; had &ldquo;simply coined money&rdquo; as a
      cotton-broker, and left her very well off. He had died of pneumonia,
      following an attack of the &ldquo;grip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it seems kind of funny to you, getting back to America after so
      many years?&rdquo; she queried, languidly &ldquo;Things are considerably changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He admitted that this was true, and bade her good-night. She went with him
      to the door, where she gave him an inelastic handshake, accompanied by an
      invitation to call again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his bedroom at the hotel he sat before his window till late into the
      night, smoking cigarettes, and trying to pull himself together. The last
      lingering afterglow of his youth had been put out; and therewith the whole
      colour of the universe was altered. He felt that he had reversed the case
      of the <i>bourgeois gentilhomme</i>, and been dealing in bad poetry for
      twenty years,&mdash;in other words, making a sentimental ass of himself;
      and his chagrin at this was as sharp as his grief over his recent
      disillusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel Merrow was dead, but so was Pauline Lake; or perhaps Pauline Lake,
      as he had loved her, had never existed outside of his own imagination. At
      any rate, Henry Aigrefield was dead, dead as the leaves of last autumn;
      and this was another man, who wore his clothes and bore his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at his looking-glass, and he saw indeed, as he had lately been
      reminded, that this new, respectable-appearing, middle-aged personage was
      &ldquo;as gray as a rat,&rdquo;&mdash;though he did not like the figure better for its
      truth. It required several hours of hard mental labour to get the
      necessary readjustment of his faculties so much as started. The past had
      ceased to be the most important fraction of time for him; the present and
      the future had become of moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dust and confusion of his wreck, only one thing was entirely clear:
      he couldn&rsquo;t stand New York. But the question where to go was as large as
      the circumference of the earth. Straight back to Paris? Or what of that
      other region he had heard so much about during the past few days, the
      West? By and by the form of Miss Lillian Goddard began to move
      refreshingly in and out among his musings; he pictured the smile with
      which she would welcome him, if, by chance, he should turn his steps
      towards Minneapolis. It was a smile that seemed to promise a hundred
      undefined pleasantnesses, and it warmed his heart. &ldquo;If I should go to
      Minneapolis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began; then he sat stockstill in his chair
      for twenty minutes; and then he got up with the air of a man who has taken
      a vigorous resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he undressed, he hummed softly to himself a line or two of his
      favourite poet,&mdash;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE cause of the
      uproar proved to be simple enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emerging into the Bischofsplatz, from the street that I had followed, I
      found a great crowd gathered before the Marmorhof, shouting, &ldquo;Death to
      Conrad!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where is Mathilde?&rdquo; with all the force of its collective
      lungs. The Marmorhof was the residence of Prince Conrad, brother to the
      reigning Grand Duke Otto&mdash;reigning, indeed, but now very old and ill,
      and like to die. The legitimate successor to the throne would have been
      Otto&rsquo;s grand-daughter, Mathilde, the only surviving child of his eldest
      son, Franz-Victor, who had been dead these ten years. But the Grand Duke&rsquo;s
      brother, Conrad, was covetous of her rights; covetous, and, as her friends
      alleged, unscrupulous. For a long while, it was said, Mathilde had been in
      terror of her life. Conrad was unscrupulous, and, were she but out of the
      way, Conrad would come to reign. Rumour, indeed, whispered that he had
      made three actual attempts to compass her death: two by poison, one by the
      dagger, each, thanks to some miracle, unsuccessful. But, a fortnight
      since, upon the first supervention of fatal symptoms in the malady of poor
      old Otto, Mathilde had mysteriously disappeared. Her whereabouts unknown,
      all X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;was in commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has fled and is in hiding,&rdquo; surmised some people, &ldquo;to escape the
      designs of her wicked uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; retorted others, &ldquo;but he, the wicked uncle himself, has kidnapped
      and sequestered her, perhaps even made away with her. Who can tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As an inquiring stranger, the situation interested me, and, from the top
      of a convenient doorstep, I gazed now upon this deep-voiced Teutonic mob
      with a good deal of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have numbered upwards of a thousand individuals, compact in its
      centre and near the palace, but scattering towards its edges; a sea of
      faces, of pale, frowning faces; a surging, troubled sea. Young men&rsquo;s faces
      for the most part; many of them beardless. &ldquo;Students from the University,&rdquo;
       I guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own station was at the outskirts of the assemblage, the station of a
      casual spectator. Sharing my door-step with me were a couple of
      sharp-faced priests, two or three prettyish young girls&mdash;bareheaded,
      presumably escaped from some of the neighbouring shops&mdash;and a young
      man with a pointed black beard, rather long black hair, and a
      broad-brimmed, soft felt hat, who somehow looked as if he might be a
      member of that guild to which I myself belonged, the ancient and
      questionable company of artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him I addressed myself for information.... &ldquo;Students, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, their leaders are students. The students and the artisans of the
      town are of the princess&rsquo;s party. The army, the clergy, and the country
      folk are for the prince.&rdquo; He had discerned from my accent that I was a
      foreigner: whence, doubtless, the fulness of his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a harmless mob enough,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;They make a lot of noise,
      to be sure; but that breaks no bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just the point,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The princess&rsquo;s friends fight only with
      their throats. Otherwise the present complication might never have
      arisen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the multitude continued to shout its loudest; and for Conrad, on
      the whole, the quarter-hour must have been a bad one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, however, the call of a bugle wound in the distance, and drew
      nearer and nearer, till the bugler in person appeared, gorgeous in
      uniform, mounted upon a white horse, advancing slowly up the
      Bischofsplatz, towards the crowd, trumpeting with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A signal to disperse,&rdquo; answered my companion. &ldquo;He looks like a
      major-general, doesn&rsquo;t he? But he&rsquo;s only a trumpet-sergeant, and he&rsquo;s
      followed at a hundred yards by a battalion of infantry. His trumpet-blast
      is by way of warning. Disperse! Or, if you tarry, beware the soldiery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His warning does not seem to pass unheeded,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re a chicken-hearted lot, these friends of the princess,&rdquo; he
      assented contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the mob had begun to melt. In a few minutes only a few stragglers
      in knots here and there were left, amongst them my acquaintance and
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a handsome young fellow, with a thin dark face, bright brown eyes,
      and a voice so soft that if I had heard without seeing him, I should
      almost have supposed the speaker to be a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We, too, had better be off,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And prove ourselves also chicken-hearted?&rdquo; queried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, discretion is the better part of valour,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should like to see the arrival of the military,&rdquo; I submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Like or not, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to now,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Here they
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a murmurous tramp, tramp, they were pouring into the Bischofsplatz
      from the side streets leading to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must take to our heels, said my young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were merely on-lookers,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conscious innocence,&rdquo; laughed he. &ldquo;Nevertheless, we had better run for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, with our fellow loiterers, we began ignominiously to run away. But
      before we had run far we were stopped by the voice of an officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt! Halt! Halt, or we fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As one man we halted. The officer rode up to us, and, with true military
      taciturnity, vouchsafed not a word either in question or explanation, but
      formed us in ranks of four abreast, and surrounded us with his men. Then
      he gave the command to march. We were, perhaps, two dozen captives, all
      told, and a good quarter of our number were women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we in for now?&rdquo; I wondered aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgrace, decapitation, deprivation of civil rights, or, say, a night in
      the Castle of St. Michael, at the very least,&rdquo; replied my friend,
      shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that will be romantic,&rdquo; said I, feeling like one launched upon a life
      of adventure.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e was right We
      were marched across the town and into the courtyard of the Castle of St
      Michael. By the time we got there, and the heavy oaken gates were shut
      behind us, it was nearly dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you pass the night,&rdquo; announced our officer. &ldquo;In the morning&mdash;humph,
      we will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say they are going to afford us no better accommodation
      than this?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; replied the dark young man. &ldquo;Fortunately, however, the
      night is warm, the skies are clear, and to commune with the stars is
      reputed to be elevating for the spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our officer had vanished into the castle, leaving us a corporal and three
      privates as a guard of honour. We, the prisoners, gathered together in the
      middle of the courtyard, and held a sort of impromptu indignation meeting.
      The women were especially eloquent in their complaints. Two of these I
      recognized as having been among my neighbours of the door-step, and we
      exchanged compassionate glances. The other four were oldish women, who
      wore caps and aprons, and looked like servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cooks,&rdquo; whispered my comrade. &ldquo;Some good burghers will be kept waiting
      for their suppers. Oh, what a lark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our convention finally broke up with a resolution to the effect that,
      though we had been most shabbily treated, there was nothing to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must suffer and be still. Let us make ourselves as comfortable as we
      can, and seek distraction in an interchange of ideas,&rdquo; proposed my mate.
      He seated himself upon a barrel that lay lengthwise against the castle
      wall, and motioned to me to place myself beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are English?&rdquo; he inquired, in an abrupt German way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it is the same thing. A tourist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it is the same thing?&rdquo; I questioned sadly. &ldquo;You little know.
      But&mdash;&mdash;yes, I am a tourist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been long in X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, what have you found to keep you here three days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a painter. The town is paintable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still life! <i>Nature morte!</i>&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is the dullest little
      town in Christendom. But I&rsquo;m glad you are a painter. I am a musician&mdash;a
      fiddler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected we were of the same ilk,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you, though? That was shrewd. But I, too, seemed to scent a kindred
      soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is my card. If we&rsquo;re not beheaded in the morning, I hope we may see
      more of each other,&rdquo; I went on, warming up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took my card, and, by the light of a match struck for the occasion,
      read aloud, &ldquo;Mr. Arthur Wainwright,&rdquo; pronouncing the English name without
      difficulty. &ldquo;I have no card, but my name is Sebastian Roch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak English?&rdquo; was my inference. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I speak a kind of
      English,&rdquo; he confessed, using the tongue in question. He had scarcely a
      trace of a foreign accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak it uncommonly well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I learned it as a child, and then I have relatives in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose there would be any objection to our smoking?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! let us smoke by all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I offered him my cigarette case. Our cigarettes afire, we resumed our
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, what in your opinion is the truth about Mathilde?&rdquo; I began. &ldquo;Is
      she in voluntary hiding, or is her uncle at the bottom of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is too hard a riddle,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I know nothing about it,
      and I have scarcely an opinion. But I may say very frankly that I am not
      of her partisans. She has no worse enemy than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Really? I&rsquo;m surprised at that. I thought all the youth of X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      were devoted to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a harmless enough person in her way, perhaps, and I have nothing
      positive to charge against her; only I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s made of the stuff
      for a reigning monarch. She&rsquo;s too giddy, too light-headed; she thinks too
      little of her dignity. Court ceremonial is infinitely tiresome to her; and
      the slow, dead life of X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; she fairly hates. Harmless,
      necessary X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; she has been known to call it. She was
      never meant to be the captain of this tiny ship of State; and with such a
      crew! You should see the ministers and courtiers! Dry bones and parchment,
      puffed up with tedious German eddigette! She was born a Bohemian, an
      artist, like you or me. I pity her, poor thing&mdash;I pity everyone whose
      destiny it is to inhabit this dreary Principality&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t
      approve of her. She, too, by-the-by, plays the violin. My own thought is,
      beware of fiddling monarchs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hint a Nero.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay a Nero crossed with a Haroun-al-Raschid. I fear her reign would be
      diversified by many a midnight escapade, like the merry Caliph&rsquo;s, only
      without his intermixture of wrong-righting. She&rsquo;d seek her own amusement
      solely; though to seek that in X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! you might as well
      seek for blood in a broomstick. Oh, she&rsquo;d make no end of mischief. The
      devil hath no agent like a woman bored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather true.&rdquo; I agreed, laughing, &ldquo;And Conrad? What of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Conrad&rsquo;s a beast; a squint-eyed, calculating beast. But a beast might
      make a good enough Grand Duke; and anyhow, a beast is all that a beastly
      little Grand Duchy like this deserves. However, to tell you my secret
      feeling, I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;ll have the chance to prove it. Mathilde, for
      all her ennui, is described as tenacious of her rights, and as a cleverish
      little body, too, down at bottom.. That is inconsistent, but there&rsquo;s the
      woman of it. I can&rsquo;t help suspecting, somehow, that unless he has really
      killed and buried her, she will contrive by hook or crook to come to her
      throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night was long, though we accomplished a lot of talking: cold it
      seemed, too, though we were in midsummer. I dozed a little, with the stone
      wall of the castle for my pillow, half-conscious all the while that
      Sebastian Roch was carrying on a bantering flirtation with the two young
      girls. At daybreak our guard was changed. At six o&rsquo;clock we were visited
      by a dapper little lieutenant, who looked us over, asked our names and
      other personal questions, scratched his chin for a moment reflectively,
      and finally, with an air of inspiration, bade us begone. The gates were
      thrown open and we issued from our prison, free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been almost a sensation,&rdquo; said Sebastian Roch. &ldquo;So one can
      experience almost a sensation, even in X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! Live and
      learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not a patriot,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I am patriotism incarnate. Only I find my country dull. If
      that be treason, make the most of it. I could not love thee, dear, so
      well, loved I not dulness less. It is not every night of my life that I am
      arrested, and sit on a barrel smoking cigarettes with an enlightened
      foreigner. The English are not generally accounted a lively race, but by
      comparison with the inhabitants of X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;they shine like
      diamonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; I acquiesced. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not English&mdash;I&rsquo;m American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I perceive from your accent,&rdquo; answered he impertinently. &ldquo;But as I
      told you once before, it amounts to the same thing. You wear your rue with
      a difference, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of sensations,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I would sell my birthright for a cup of
      coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find no coffee-house awake at this hour,&rdquo; said Sebastian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll wake one up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! and provoke a violation of the law. By law they&rsquo;re not allowed to
      open till seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, laws be hanged! I must have a cup of coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you are delightful,&rdquo; asserted Sebastian, putting his arm through
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently we came to a beer hall, at whose door I began to bang. My friend
      stood by, shaking with laughter, Which seemed to me disproportionate to
      the humour of the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are easily amused,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, far from it. But this is such a lark you know,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by, we were seated opposite each other at a table, sipping hot
      coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I looked at Sebastian Roch I observed a startling phenomenon. The apex
      of his right whisker had become detached from the skin, and was standing
      out half an inch aloof from his cheek! The sight sent a shiver down my
      spine. It was certainly most unnatural. His eyes were bright, his voice
      was soft, he spoke English like a man and a brother, and his character
      seemed whimsical and open; but his beard, his dashing, black, pointed
      beard&mdash;which I&rsquo;m not sure I hadn&rsquo;t been envying him a little&mdash;was
      eerie, and, instinctively I felt for my watch. It was safe in its place
      and so was my purse. Therefore, at the door of the Bierhaus, in due time,
      we bade each other a friendly good-bye, he promising to look me up one of
      these days at my hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have enjoyed your society more than you can think,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some of
      these days I will drop in and see you, <i>à limproviste</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat afternoon I
      again found myself in the Bischofsplatz, seated at one of the open-air
      tables of the café, when a man passed me, clad in the garb of a Franciscan
      monk. He had a pointed black beard, this monk, and a pair of flashing dark
      eyes; and, though he quickly drew his head into his cowl at our
      conjunction, I had no difficulty whatever in identifying him with my
      queerly-hirsute prison mate, Sebastian Roch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! he has become a monk. It must have been a swift conversion,&rdquo;
       thought I, looking after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He marched straight across the Bischofsplatz and into the courtyard of the
      Marmorhof, where he was lost to view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beggar! He is one of Conrad&rsquo;s spies,&rdquo; I concluded: and I searched my
      memory, to recall if I had said anything that might compromise me in the
      course of our conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours later I sat down to my dinner in the coffee-room of the Hôtel
      de Rome, and was about to fall to at the good things before me, when I was
      arrested in the act by a noise of hurrying feet on the pavement without,
      and a tumult of excited voices. Something clearly was &ldquo;up&rdquo;; and, not to
      miss it, I hurried to the street-door of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      There I discovered mine host and hostess, supported by the entire <i>personnel</i>
      of their establishment, agape with astonishment, as a loquacious citizen
      poured news into their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Otto is dead,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He died at six o&rsquo;clock. And Conrad has been
      assassinated. It was between four and five this afternoon. A Franciscan
      monk presented himself at the Marmorhof, and demanded an audience of the
      prince. The guard, of course, refused him admittance; but he was
      determined, and at last the Prince&rsquo;s Chamberlain gave him a hearing. The
      upshot was he wrote a word or two upon a slip of paper, sealed it with
      wax, and begged that it might be delivered to his Highness forthwith,
      swearing that it contained information of the utmost importance to his
      welfare. The chamberlain conveyed his paper to the prince, who, directly
      he had read it, uttered a great oath, and ordered that the monk be ushered
      into his presence, and that they be left alone together. More than an hour
      passed. At a little after six arrived the news of the death of the old
      duke. An officer entered the prince&rsquo;s chamber, to report it to him. There,
      if you please, he found his Highness stretched out dead upon the floor,
      with a knife in his heart. The monk had vanished. They could find no trace
      whatever of his whereabouts. Also had vanished the paper he had sent in to
      the prince. But, what the police regard as an important clue, he had left
      another paper, twisted round the handle of the dagger, whereon was
      scrawled, in a disguised hand: &lsquo;In the country of the blind, it may be,
      the one-eyed men are kings, but Conrad only squinted!&rsquo; And now the grand
      point of it all is this,&mdash;shut up in an inner apartment of the
      Marmorhof, they have found the Hereditary Grand Duchess Mathilde, alive
      and well. Conrad has been keeping her a prisoner there these two weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tidings thus delivered proved to be correct. &ldquo;The Duke is dead! Long
      live the Duchess!&rdquo; cried the populace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a dear old-fashioned blood-and-thunder opera, and I was almost
      behind the scenes. But oh, that hypocritical young fiddler-monk, Sebastian
      Roch! Would he make good his promise, after this, to look me up? The
      police were said to be prosecuting a diligent endeavour to look <i>him</i>
      up, but with, as yet, indifferent success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, upon the accession of the new ruler, the print shops of the
      town displayed her Highness&rsquo;s portraits for sale&mdash;photographs and
      chromo-lithographs; you paid your money and you took your choice. These
      represented her as a slight young woman, with a delicate, interesting
      face, a somewhat sarcastic mouth, a great abundance of yellowish hair, and
      in striking contrast to this, a pair of brilliant dark eyes&mdash;on the
      whole, a picturesque and pleasing, if not conventionally a handsome,
      person. I could not for the life of me have explained it, but there was
      something in her face that annoyed me with a sense of having seen it
      before, though I was sure I never had. In the course of a fortnight,
      however, I did see her&mdash;caught a flying glimpse of her as she drove
      through the Marktstrasse in her victoria, attended by all manner of pomp
      and circumstance. She lay back upon her cushions, looking pale and
      interesting, but sadly bored, and responded with a languid smile to the
      hat-lifting of her subjects. I stared at her intently, and again I
      experienced that exasperating sensation of having seen her somewhere&mdash;where?&mdash;when?&mdash;in
      what circumstances?&mdash;before.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne night I was
      awakened from my slumbers by a violent banging at my door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open&mdash;open in the name of the law!&rdquo; commanded a deep bass voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! what can the row be now?&rdquo; I wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open, or we break in the door,&rdquo; cried the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must really give me time to put something on,&rdquo; I protested, and
      hurriedly wrapped myself in some clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A magnificently uniformed young officer stepped into the room, followed by
      three gendarmes with drawn sabres. The officer inclined his head slightly,
      and said: &ldquo;Herr Veinricht, ich glaube?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His was not the voice that I had heard through the door, gruff and
      trombone-like, but a much softer voice, and much higher in pitch. Somehow
      it did not seem altogether the voice of a stranger to me, and yet the face
      of a stranger his face emphatically was&mdash;a very florid face,
      surmounted by a growth of short red hair, and decorated by a bristling red
      moustache. His eyes were overhung by bushy red eyebrows, and, in the
      uncertain candlelight, I could not make out their colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am Herr Veinricht,&rdquo; I admitted, resigning myself to this German
      version of my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;English?&rdquo; he questioned curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not English&mdash;American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Macht nichts! I arrest you in the name of the Grand Duchess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest me! Will you be good enough to inform me upon what charge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon the charge of consorting with dangerous characters, and being an
      enemy to the tranquillity of the State. You will please to dress as
      quickly as possible. A carriage awaits you below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! they have somehow connected me with Sebastian Roch,&rdquo; I groaned
      inwardly. And I began to put certain finishing touches to my toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried the officer. &ldquo;You must put on your dress-suit. Can you be
      so ignorant of criminal etiquette as not to know that State prisoners are
      required to wear their dress-suits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems an absurd regulation,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I will put on my
      dress-suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will await you outside your door; but let me warn you, should you
      attempt to escape through your window, you will be shot in a hundred
      places,&rdquo; said the officer, and retired with his minions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole population of the hotel were in the corridors through which I
      had presently to pass with my custodians, and they pressed after us to the
      street. A closed carriage stood there, with four horses attached, each
      &ldquo;near&rdquo; horse bearing a postilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three other horses, saddled, were tied to posts about the hotel entrance.
      These the gendarmes mounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you enter the carriage?&rdquo; said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my spirit rose in arms. &ldquo;I insist upon knowing what I&rsquo;m arrested for.
      I want to understand the definite nature of the charge against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a magistrate. Will you kindly enter the carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is a downright outrage,&rdquo; I declared, and entered the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer leaped in after me, the door was slammed to, the postilions
      yelled at their horses, off we drove, followed by the rhythmical
      clank-clank of the gendarmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to get at the meaning of all this, you know,&rdquo; I informed my
      captor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, you do not begin to appreciate the premises. One less
      ignorant of military fashions would have perceived from my coat long since
      that I am a provost-marshal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what of that? I suppose you are none the less able to explain
      my position to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Position, sir! This is trifling. But I must caution you that whatever you
      say will be remembered, and, if incriminating, used against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a breach of international comity,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we are the best of friends with England,&rdquo; he said, lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am an American, I would have you to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Macht nichts!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Macht nichts!&rdquo; I echoed, angrily. &ldquo;You think so! I shall bring the case
      to the notice of the United States Legation, and you shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? And precipitate a war between two friendly powers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You laugh! but who laughs last laughs best, and I promise you the Grand
      Duchy of X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;shall be made to pay for this pleasantry
      with a vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not the first time you have been arrested while in these
      dominions,&rdquo; he said, sternly, &ldquo;and I must remind you that lèse-majesté is
      a hanging matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lèse-majesté!&rdquo; I repeated, half in scorn, half in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ya wohl, mein Herr,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But, after all, I am simply obeying
      orders,&rdquo; he added, with an inflection almost apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where had I heard of that curious soft voice before? A voice so soft that
      his German sounded almost like Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile we had driven across the town, past the walls, and into the open
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are perhaps conducting me to the frontier?&rdquo; I suggested, deriving
      some relief from the fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hardly so far as that, let us hope,&rdquo; he answered, with what struck me
      as a suppressed chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Can you use the word in speaking of a
      pocket-handkerchief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is small, but it is picturesque, it is paintable,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And, what
      is more, by every syllable you utter against it you weave a strand into
      your halter, and drive a nail into your coffin. Suicide is imprudent, not
      to say immoral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could meet you on equal terms,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I would pay you for your
      derision with a good sound Anglo-Saxon thrashing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tiger&rsquo;s heart wrapped in a painter&rsquo;s hide,&rdquo; he retorted, laughing
      outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove on in silence for perhaps a quarter of an hour longer; then at
      last our horses&rsquo; hoofs resounded upon stone, and we drew up. My officer
      descended from the carriage; I followed him. We were standing under a
      massive archway lighted by a hanging lantern. Before a small door pierced
      in the stone wall fronting us a sentinel was posted, with his musket
      presented in salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three gendarmes sprang from their saddles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, Herr Veinricht,&rdquo; said the provost-marshal. &ldquo;I have enjoyed our
      drive together more than I can tell you.&rdquo; Then turning to his
      subordinates, &ldquo;Conduct this gentleman to the Tower chamber,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the gendarmes preceding me, the other two coming behind, I was
      conveyed up a winding stone staircase, into a big octagonal-shaped room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was lighted by innumerable candles set in sconces round the
      walls. It was comfortably, even richly furnished, and decorated with a
      considerable degree of taste. A warm-hued Persian carpet covered the stone
      floor; books, pictures, bibelots, were scattered discriminatingly about;
      and in one corner there stood a grand piano, open, with a violin and bow
      lying on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My gendarmes bowed themselves out, shutting the door behind them with an
      ominous clangour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this is my dungeon cell,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;I shall not be so uncomfortable,
      after all. But how preposterous of them to force me to wear my
      dress-suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I threw myself into an easy-chair, buried my face in my hands, and tried
      to reflect upon my situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can&rsquo;t tell how much time may have passed in this way; perhaps twenty
      minutes or half an hour. Then, suddenly, I was disturbed by the sound of a
      light little cough behind me, a discreet little &ldquo;ahem.&rdquo; I looked up
      quickly. A lady had entered the apartment, and was standing in the middle
      of it, smiling in contemplation of my desperate attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; I gasped, but not audibly, as her face grew clear to my
      startled sight. &ldquo;The Grand Duchess her self!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you, Mr. Wainwright,&rdquo; her Highness began, in English. &ldquo;X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      is a dull little place&mdash;oh, believe me, the dullest of its size in
      Christendom&mdash;and they tell me you are an amusing man. I trust they
      tell the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course the reader has foreseen it from the outset; otherwise why should
      I be detaining him with this anecdote? But upon me it came as a
      thunderbolt; and in my emotion I forgot myself, and exclaimed aloud,
      &ldquo;Sebastian Roch!&rdquo; The face of the Grand Duchess had haunted me with a
      sense of familiarity; the voice of my redheaded officer in the carriage
      had seemed not strange to me; but now that I saw the face, and heard the
      voice, at one and the same time, all was clear&mdash;&ldquo;Sebastian Roch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; the gracious lady questioned, arching her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, madame. I was about to thank your Highness for her kindness, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your mind wandered, and you made some irrelevant military observation
      about a bastion rock. It is, perhaps, aphasia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very probably,&rdquo; I assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are a man of honour, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The English generally are. You can keep a State secret, especially when
      you happen to have learned it by a sort of accident, can you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a tomb for such things, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well. And besides, you must consider that not all homicide is
      murder. Sometimes one is driven to kill in self-defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not a doubt of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only sorry it should, all have happened before you saw him. His
      squint was a rarity; it would have pleased your sense of humour. X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;is
      the dullest little principality,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;oh, but dull, dull, dull!
      I am sometimes forced in despair to perpetrate little jokes. Yet you have
      actually stopped here five weeks. It must be as they say, that the English
      people take their pleasures sadly. You are a painter, I am told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Highness; I make a shift at painting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I at fiddling. But I lack a discriminating audience. I think you had
      better paint my portrait. I will play my fiddle to you. Between whiles we
      will talk. On occasions, I may tell you, I smoke cigarettes; one must have
      some excitement. We will try to enliven things a little. Do you think we
      shall succeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should not despair of doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nice of you. I have a most ridiculous High Chancellor; you might
      draw caricatures of him. And my First Lady of the Chamber has a
      preposterous lisp. I do hope I shall be amused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she extended her left hand towards me; I took it, and was
      about to give it a friendly shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not that,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Oh, I forgot, you are an American, and the
      ABC of court etiquette is Sanskrit to you. Must I tell you what to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To cut a long story short, I thought my lines had fallen unto me in
      extremely pleasant places; and so, indeed, they had&mdash;for a while. I
      passed a merry summer at the Court of X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, alternating
      between the Residenz in town, and the Schloss beyond the walls. I made a
      good many preliminary studies for the princess&rsquo;s portrait, whilst she
      played her violin; and between times, as she had promised, we talked,
      practised court etiquette, smoked cigarettes, and laughed at scandal. But
      when I began upon the final canvas, I at least had to become a little
      sober. I wanted to make a masterpiece of it. We had two or three sittings,
      during which I worked away in grim silence, and the Grand Duchess yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one night I was again roused from the middle of my slumbers, taken in
      custody by a colonel of dragoons, conducted to a closed carriage, and
      driven abroad through the darkness. When our carriage came to a standstill
      we found ourselves in the Austrian village of Z&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      beyond the X&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; frontier There Colonel von
      Schlangewurtzel bade me good-bye. At the same time he handed me a letter.
      I hastened to tear it open. Upon a sheet of court paper, in a pretty
      feminine hand, I read these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised to amuse me. But it seems you take your droll British art <i>au
      grand sérieux</i>. We have better portrait-painters among our natives; and
      you will find models cheap and plentiful at Z&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
